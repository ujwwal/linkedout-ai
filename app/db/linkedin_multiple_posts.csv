if you create money models, you systematically generate higher upfront profits, acquire customers more effectively, and consistently outspend competitors.

I've created countless money models over the past decade to help my businesses gross over 9-figures. Here's a real life example of one money model I created: Real-World Example from my Gym Launch Model.

Traditional Gym Approach:
↳ Low-ticket upfront offers ($21 for 21 days).
↳ High customer acquisition cost ($53 max spend per lead).
↳ Long wait (months) to achieve return on ad spend.

Alex’s Superior Money Model:
↳ Initial high-ticket front-end sale (e.g., $500 six-week challenge).
↳ Immediate upsell of complementary high-margin products (supplements, ~$200).
↳ Continuity offer (membership rollover at higher price).
↳ Additional premium offers (discounted annual prepayment) to further boost immediate revenue.

Took me 3 damn years.
Here's everything I learned

Back in 2020, my friend Manish told me
“Bro, LinkedIn is where you build businesses.”

I didn’t get it.
But I made an account anyway.

For 2 years I was just throwing random shit here.
NFT art, tiny wins, some cringe posts.
Nobody cared.

But it gave me confidence.
Confidence that I can hit publish without overthinking.
Confidence that I can talk my mind.

Most people don’t post because they’re scared of looking stupid.
Guess what... you will look stupid.

Your first 100 posts will be trash.
But that’s the price of getting better.

Then my company died.
Elite NFT shut down.

That’s when I said fu*k it, let’s build in public.

I started posting everything.
The downfall, the broke days, the rebuild.
People actually started listening.

And that’s when it clicked.
Consistency is the real hack.
Show up. Drop value.

Miss a day? Cool.
Just come back. Don’t ghost.

I also learned the game.
First 3 lines decide if your post lives or dies.

Wins work.
Struggle stories work.
Underdog arcs kill.

And the biggest cheat code?
Stop gatekeeping.

When I started sharing raw,
how I was building BeHooked,
what flopped, what actually worked,
that’s when people connected.

Because LinkedIn doesn’t reward polish.
It rewards honesty.
It rewards consistency.
It rewards storytelling.

10K feels nice.
But honestly... the best part?
Knowing it all started with one shitty, imperfect post that I was too tired to overthink.

I built 2 billion dollar companies doing the opposite.

3 boring things. Done obsessively.

Here's what actually works:


1. Pick One Thing

Not three priorities.

Not five goals.

One obsession.

Most companies die from doing too much, not too little.


2. Measure Daily

What gets tracked gets improved.

If you can't measure it daily, you can't manage it.


3. Build Systems

Your business should run without you.

Daily workouts don't feel rewarding when you're sore and tired.

They feel amazing when you're 50 and stronger than most 30-year-olds.

Reading 20 pages a day doesn't seem like much.

It's life-changing when you've consumed 50 books in 2 years.

Scaling without culture is.

Most founders obsess over growth metrics.

ARR.
Headcount.
Funding rounds.

But they forget the invisible foundation that holds everything together.

Culture isn't ping pong tables and free snacks.

Culture is belonging.

And belonging comes from one thing:

Cadence.

The Monday email you send to your team.

The weekly culture call where someone shares a book they love.

The consistent appreciation you show for the janitor and the COO equally.

Every Monday.
Every week.
Every interaction.

When systems break (and they will), culture forgives.

When you write that email on a bad day...

Culture gives you the benefit of the doubt.

When market conditions shift...

Culture rallies around the vision.

Here's the truth most leadership gurus won't tell you:

You can't define culture before it happens.

You can only build it through the daily cadence of communication and care.

I write my top 10 wins every Friday.

We used to have 30-minute culture calls every week.

Someone would share one thing they loved. Could be a book, a story, a Wikipedia page.

Simple? Yes.
Easy? No.
Transformative? Absolutely.

Start with a generic job description.

They search online, copy-paste a template, “put their spin on it,” and hope the right candidate shows up.

When I hired a General Counsel, I did the opposite:

I took 20 minutes to write every bullet point myself.

That simple act did two things:

1 - It forced me to clarify exactly what the role needed to achieve.

2 - It filtered out the wrong candidates before we even started interviews.

The interview process became faster, cleaner, and more decisive.

Why?

Because clarity came first.

Before you hire your next key role, will you take the time to make the description bulletproof…

It’s not how much they already know.

When I pick someone to lead, I don’t expect them to know everything.

Because nobody knows everything. Not me, not you, not the smartest guy in the room.

The difference between a follower and a leader is simple:
What do they do when they don’t know?

Some people freeze.
They wait for instructions.
They push responsibility upwards.
And that’s how you know they aren’t ready.

But the ones who are ready?

They don’t stop.
They figure it out.
They ask the right questions, call the right people, test, fail, test again until the problem is solved.

That’s one quality I really care about.

Because everything changes markets, tech, rules, information.

But if you have the ability to move forward even when you don’t know what’s next, then you’ll never be stuck for too long.

And I've never trusted anyone who told me to.

Growing up…

Mum worked in a supermarket.
Dad did night shifts at the factory.

There was plenty of love, laughter, and always food on the table - but also stress about money.

❌ No family holidays abroad
❌ No fancy school trips
❌ No safety net if things went wrong

So when I got to uni, and my middle-class friends talked about ""gap years"" and ""finding themselves""...

I didn't even know what that meant 😅

I saw students around me with wealthy parents.

Talking about internships at Goldman Sachs.
Summer houses in the Cotswolds.
Networks that opened doors.

That's when I realised:

Success isn't just about working hard.

It's about dreaming bigger than your circumstances.

So I started Simmer from my uni kitchen.

While my friends partied, I was:

→ Cooking meals at 1am
→ Delivering food between lectures
→ Reinvesting every penny back into the business

People thought I was crazy.

""Why don't you just enjoy the uni experience?""

But I had a different vision:

💭 To retire my Dad from factory work making him ill
💭 To help my Mum tick off her own bucket list
💭 To create generational wealth

8 years later...

That side hustle I started at uni is:

✅ Europe's fastest-growing food business
✅ We've served over 100,000 people nationwide
✅ Both my parents are retired and mortgage paid

And we did it all without investors.

Without connections.

Without a safety net.

Just grit, sacrifice, and refusing to accept limits.

""Be realistic, dream within your means.""

Nah.

So how does Dubai ACTUALLY work? 🤔

Most countries rely heavily on income tax to function.
The UAE doesn't.

Yet they build jaw-dropping services at crazy speed.

Here's the economic model that makes it possible:

___

1/ Oil revenue provides only 1% of Dubai's GDP today.

This surprised me the most.
They've diversified brilliantly away from oil dependency.

___

2/ Corporate taxes on foreign banks and oil companies (20-55%).

While most businesses pay zero corporate tax, these sectors contribute significantly.

___

3/ Value-Added Tax (5% since 2018).

Lower than the UK's 20%, but generates substantial revenue across a massive consumer base.

___

4/ Tourism fees and hotel taxes (5-7% per night).

With 14+ million tourists annually, this adds up quickly.

___

5/ Knowledge fees, innovation fees, and municipality charges (2-5%).

Small percentages added to utility bills, business licenses, visa applications, car registrations, and add up to billions annually.

___

6/ Government-owned businesses generate massive profits.

Emirates Airlines, DP World (ports), Emaar (real estate) - the government owns stakes in all major industries.

___

7/ Real estate registration fees (4% of property value).

With some of the world's most valuable real estate, this is a goldmine.

___

8/ Business license fees ($1,000-$10,000+ annually).

With thousands of new businesses launching yearly, this creates steady revenue.

___

9/ Customs duties (5% on most imports).

As a global trade hub, the volume makes this significant.

___

10/ Road tolls (Salik) + parking fees throughout the city.

Small individual amounts but massive scale.

___

The genius?

It's in the diversification.

Instead of taking 20-40% from individual salaries, Dubai collects lots of small percentages across a wide range of activities.

This attracts talent and investment.

While STILL funding the infrastructure.

Would this model work in the UK?

Probably not entirely.

Different history.
Different resources.
Different social systems.
Different population size.

... and don't get me started on the UK mindset towards money, ambition, and entrepreneurship 🤦🏽‍♂️

But there are defo lessons we could apply.

Like efficiency, diversification and encouraging entrepreneurship.

Dubai rolls out the red carpet.

I've spent a week here and am starting to understand why entrepreneurs are flocking here.

It's not just the zero income tax.

It's the entire system:

___

1/ Free zones are entrepreneurial playgrounds.

Dubai has 40+ specialised free zones where you get:

100% foreign ownership
0% corporate tax (often guaranteed for 15-50yrs)
100% repatriation of capital and profits
No currency restrictions

Each zone focuses on a specific industry - fintech, media, healthcare, logistics.

___

2/ Banking is designed for global business.

UK banking for businesses? Weeks of scrutiny, limited international services, and CONSTANT compliance headaches.

Dubai's banks offer multi-currency accounts almost instantly.

Global payment solutions, and minimal paperwork.

They WANT your business.

___

3/ Visa processes that make sense.

UK visas for entrepreneurs are extremely selective and bureaucratic.

Dubai offers entrepreneur visas for as little as £3,000, processed in days, not months.

They're literally inviting you in.

___

4/ Government services that function like companies.

Every service is available via apps.

Need a business license? 15 minutes on your phone.
Utility connections? Same day.
Tax filing? Almost non-existent.

The mindset difference is striking:

In the UK, the default answer is ""no, unless...""
In Dubai, it's ""yes, and here's how...""

___

There's a reason thousands of UK entrepreneurs have relocated here.

The system is designed to help you win...

Not hold you back.

Is Dubai perfect? Absolutely not.

But they've created the most frictionless business environment I've ever experienced.

The UK could learn a lot from this approach.

Anyone else agree?

- OpenAI Staff Cash Out Billions & Sam Altman Will Spend Trillions
- CoreWeave’s $11BN Debt Bet
- Nubank’s $2.5BN Profit Shocker

&better than ever and my 4 takeaways 👇

1. Databricks $100BN is Still Cheap

- $4BN ARR, growing 50% vs. Snowflake’s 26%.
- It is the AI infra bet.
- The valuation will look reasonable if AI keeps growing for 2–3 years.

2. OpenAI’s $6B Secondary is a Talent Retention Weapon

- Meta has been dangling $100M cash packages for AI engineers.
- Secondary liquidity lets employees cash out while still compounding at OpenAI
- Vest, sell a slice, and keep f**king building.

3. There is No “Sell” Button in Private Markets

- In public markets, you can sell when you’re wrong.
- In private markets, you ride it all the way down.

4. Nubank’s $2.5BN Profit: Full-Stack Fintech is Winning

- They did deposits + lending and cleaned the deck on incumbents at true LatAm scale.
- They have real profits with 123M customers
- Avoid doing “dumb bank stuff” and there’s room to run.

My 6 takeaways 👇

1. AI Startups Are Like Chickens and Cannons

- They are like chickens shot out of cannons & there are new chickens shot out every day.
- Once you get traction it’s all about flapping your wings as fast as possible.
- As long as you are flapping faster than other chickens, you will be fine.

2. How Does Anton Think About How Long He Can Delay Margin Focus and Optimisation For

- He has 2 pieces of conflicting perspective:
- Optimize payback times and margins early to grow efficiently and sustainably.
Prioritize user love and mindshare now, monetize and improve margins later.

3. How Does the Unicorn Founder of Lovable Analyse GPT-5

- Initially we did a deep dive on GPT-5’s impact: Response time, quantitative eval, vibe check…
- We decided to give it to our users directly for feedback.
- Conclusion: Great for solving hard problems, but the model is still too ambitious.

4. How Will the Size of Eng Teams Change in the Future

- The best engineers in the best companies will act as a translation layer.
- They will become more like a project manager.
- They will be talking to customers & changing things with AI extremely fast.

5. Are We Seeing a Plateauing in the Advancement of AI

- We are still in the exponential phase of the s-curve.
- AI can still massively improve fields like science & bioengineering.
- We will eventually see a plateau.

6. Should Young People Go to University to Prep Themselves for a World of AI

- University is not the best place to learn, no matter the major.
- People need to understand how the world works & how work translates into value creation
- You don’t learn that in university.

There is so much crazy sh*t & so many questions in AI today.

- Anthropic vs. OpenAI: Where Value Accrues
- Cursor vs Replit vs Lovable: Who Wins and Who Loses
- The One Sin in AI Investing
- Why Open Source is a National Security Risk with China

My 7 takeaways 👇

1. The Biggest Sin Is Zero Sum Thinking

- There are so many questions about whether a layer has value, margins, or is defensible.
- Every layer has gained value.
- The one sin is not playing the game.

2. Have All the Foundation Model Winners Already Been Founded or World of Many More

- We will have new models with different flavours.
- We are still early: Google was a 3rd gen search engine, Facebook was a 3rd gen social network.
- There’s a lot of change to come.

3. How Will Value Disperse in New AI Markets, and How Important Is Brand Recognition in Establishing Dominance?

- The markets are so large & growing so fast, we are seeing brand effects emerge.
- Whoever becomes a household name will get the adoption.
- Market leaders will have brand monopolies until the market slows down.

4. App Providers Have a Unique Opportunity to Create Models Where LLM Providers Don’t

- Model scaling approaches aren’t generalized.
- Models that are good at coding may not be good at other things.
- App providers have an opportunity to build their own models that the large models aren’t focused on.

5. It Is a BS Argument to Suggest These Will Always Be Negative Margin Businesses

- Founders with access to relatively cheap capital need to make a trade‑off between margins and distribution during the land‑grab phase
- If they do not acquire users during that period, they will never be able to monetize them.
- Sacrificing margin for distribution is a rational decision

6. Why Chinese Open Source Is the Most Dangerous

- They are better at it than we are.
- As a result, we are seeing a proliferation of Chinese open‑source models everywhere.
- The right way for us to respond is to fuel our open source efforts.

7. Founders Can Have One Mortal Enemy to Block a Competitive Investment.

- How Do All Providers Deal with Anthropic Dependency Risk?
- Are Seed Funds F**ked? Have Mega Funds Won?
- Figma IPO Breakdown: Where Does It Price?

My 5 takeaways with&👇

1. I Would Invest in Anthropic Over OpenAI

- Three reasons:
- There is cap table clarity.
- They’ve got a working business model.
- They are exercise pricing power: We are seeing these unprofitable AI models becoming profitable.

2. Figma is cheap at this price but it is all part of the strategy.

- Their IPO is priced at 14–16× NTM with a phenomenal growth rate.
- This attracts investors: Low valuation hooks prospects into meetings and fuels demand buildup.
- Underwriters will “walk up” the price later.

3. Anti-Portfolio Trauma is the Psychological Price You Have to Pay for Being in the Game

- It is the emotional tax you pay for being in good deal flow.
- If you’re not seeing 10 great deals you are probably not going to do one great deal.
- The psychological tax for doing one great deal is you pass on nine deals or you don't win them.

4. The Best Investors Meet One Founder per Month That Can Return the Fund

- If you are an S-tier investor, you need to meet with one fund-returning founder at least once a month.
- You cannot do all the deals.
- You have to meet 8-10 a year to make money.

5. Why Mega Funds Are Always Better for the Entrepreneur

- They do more deals & have more news flow.
- They have a good brand: Lower picking ratio x higher deal volume = Constant flow of good news.
- They have massive amounts of capital: They can win deals, pay more, & have the option to stuff more money in later.

1. The V1 for the Billion-Dollar Company and How It All Started.

- I’ve worked in this space for a long time and had a clear vision on what to build.
- I built V1 in a couple of weeks instead of waiting to fundraise & hire engineers.
- There was already a giant demand.

2. Why Are Our Competitors are Just Human Body Shops With No Technology?

- They do not have any algorithms to measure the quality of data they’re producing.
- They hire anybody with a CS PhD & pass them along to AI companies.
- They are body shops masquerading as a technology company.

3. The One Principle That This $30 Billion Company Will Not Let Slip.

- Quality is the most important thing.
- We will say no to a project if we cannot guarantee the quality.
- It is more important than anything else.

4. Did Scales Acquisition Lead to a Tidal Wave in Scales Customers Coming to Surge?

- Yes.
- We are already the biggest & best in this space.
- Even if teams at larger companies weren’t working with us, they already knew who to turn to.

5. Silicon Valley Is Full of Tourists That Have the Wrong Incentives

- It is a status game for most people.
- People are raising not because they want to build a product that solves an idea they fundamentally believe in.
- They are raising so they can tell their friends they raised $10M and get a TechCrunch headline.

6. Why Synthetic Data Is Not All It Is Cracked up to Be, and How That Impacts the Future of Human Labelled Data.

- Models trained heavily on synthetic data are only good at benchmark-style problems & terrible at real-world use cases.
- We’ve heard from a lot of companies that trained on synthetic data for a year before realising all the problems it’s caused.
- A couple thousand pieces of high-quality human-labelled data is worth more than 10 million pieces of synthetic data.

7. Have the Biggest Model Providers Been Created Today, or Will More Be Made in the Future?

- No, there could be more powerful model developers emerging in the coming years.
- We are still miles away from AGI.
- There could still be extremely creative breakthroughs that nobody is expecting.

- 75% of women say that economic viability is hugely important in a mate, compared with only 25% percent of men.
- Making more money as a man makes you more attractive; making more money as a woman doesn’t make a difference.

3. If a Man Has Not Lived With a Woman by the Age of 30 Their Chance of Substance Abuse Goes Way Up

- If a man hasn’t cohabitated or married by the time he is 30, there is a 1 in 3 chance he ends up a substance abuser.

When I say only Africans will build Africa,leads in so many ways.

Almost five years ago,joined forces with Afreximbank and other institutions, to raise capital for our acquisition of OML17 asset and our entry into the oil and gas sector, through. They believed in our vision of an integrated, indigenous energy play, run by Africans, benefiting Africans, and creating prosperity on the continent.

Today, that collective investment has helped to unlock the potential of our oil and gas assets and accelerated our production capacity.currently produces over 58,000 bpd and has recorded the highest production increase in Nigeria’s oil sector in the past 5 years, contributing to Nigeria’s 2 million bpd aspiration.

It was one of the largest transfers of resource assets to indigenous capital. The deal birthed, it created Africa’s largest integrated energy platform. Afreximbank was there for us. They shared the vision. The Heirs Energies deal was catalytic because it brought African resources into African value chains. At, we are one of Nigeria’s largest power providers. We cannot develop Africa without reliable electricity. Power is the foundation of everything: trade, healthcare, education, and digital inclusion.

This is Africapitalism.

I commendfor its consistent contribution to Africa’s economic growth, and I congratulate Prof. Okey Oramah on the success of this year’s Annual Meetings and the choice to host it in Nigeria. I salute the impact and legacy of retiring President Professor Benedict Oramah.

Where is Africa? In the conversation or left outside?

Young Africans are digitally native, entrepreneurial, and hungry to build. What we need are more opportunities for partnership, more belief in our potential, and platforms to amplify our voices. Africa has led in digital banking, in payments, our value chains can be transformed. We know that many of the minerals that are techs’ foundation are found in Africa. But is Africa getting the benefit? Africa needs to capture the moment – ensure we have digital sovereignty – that African priorities are understood and met.

I joined global tech leaders at an exclusive dinner at the Élysée Palace in Paris, with President Macron. I wanted to ensure there was an African voice at the table.

I had enriching conversations global tech CEOs, including Jensen Huang, CEO of NVIDIA, about how innovation can and must be used to solve humanity’s most pressing challenges, including those facing Africa.

Atwe are deeply invested in Africa’s digital transformation. Africa needs to win this battle. We are building and backing African tech champions likeandthat are not only serving African markets but are also capable of competing globally.

For me, last night was about reinforcing the message that Africa is ready and our time is now. Our young population is digitally native, entrepreneurial, and hungry to build. What we need are improved infrastructure, more opportunities for partnership, more belief in our potential, and platforms to amplify our voices.

Tech knows no borders. Innovation thrives where talent meets investment. And Africa, with the right support, should be the next frontier of global tech growth.

I say, let us choose Africa for tech, for partnerships, for the future.","Tony O. Elumelu, C.F.R"
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyelumelu/,"Global economies are undergoing a massive transformation, shaped by shifts in geopolitics, culture, demographics, technology, and volatile trade dynamics. Old certainties are gone; new certainties yet to emerge.

Where is Africa in this new world order? Africa, a continent rich in potential, with its youthful population, natural resources, and dynamic entrepreneurial spirit. Too often overlooked, the future of the world is going to be increasingly influenced by Africa and Africans. How can the world partner with Africa to unlock the huge opportunities present, for mutual and lasting benefit?

The African Development Bank forecasts that Africa's GDP will grow at an average of 4% per year over the next decade, largely driven by entrepreneurship and innovation. With internet penetration reaching 45% in 2023, Africa is enjoying a digital revolution, opening vast opportunities for connectivity and commerce. The African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) aims to create a unified market for goods and services across the continent, and according to the IMF, it is projected to boost intra-African trade by 52% by the year 2025. Traditional trade models, which have often excluded or marginalised Africa, must evolve. AfCFTA represents a bold step towards redefining trade dynamics. By uniting 55 countries into a single market of 1.3 billion people, AfCFTA has the potential to add $450 billion to Africa’s GDP by 2035.

This initiative is critical for establishing the infrastructure necessary for accelerated development. In 2022 alone, African tech startups raised a record $5 billion, a figure that continues to rise, highlighting the continent's vibrant entrepreneurial landscape. Technology is revolutionising trade and economies in ways we could not have imagined a decade ago. African innovators are creating solutions tailored to our unique challenges. Mobile money platforms have transformed financial systems, enabling millions to access banking services. E-commerce platforms are breaking down traditional barriers to trade.

These statistics illustrate the immense potential Africa offers, particularly in entrepreneurship, the backbone of the continent's economic growth. However, to harness these opportunities fully, Africa's economic growth must be equitable: Africans need to get real value from their commodity supply chain by participating, barriers to agricultural exports need to be removed, the impact of climate change acknowledged by the polluters: and inclusive: benefiting women, youth, and marginalised communities.

With over 60% of its population under the age of 25, Africa's youth represent a vast reservoir of talent and creativity. Yet, women entrepreneurs face particularly significant barriers in accessing capital, markets, and networks, while our young grapple with high unemployment rates.

Gbenga Komolafe; Chairman, OPEC Board of Governors and CEO, First E&P, Adewale Adeyemo-Bero; Executive Vice-President Upstream, NNPC Limited Udobong Ntia and CEO of Seplat Energy Plc, Roger Brown.

With a new administration and ambitious targets for production critical for Nigeria’s economic growth, the Dialogue provided a timely venue for private and public sectors to continue the successful interaction that has already seen Nigeria's crude production grow by 25%, since May 2023. Speakers highlighted how a series of Presidential Executive Orders had radically reshaped the operating environment and catalysed industry growth. Indigenous oil and gas companies were now responsible for more than 60% of Nigeria’s crude output and the successful indigenisation programme was delivering a bold new chapter in Nigeria’s natural resources history.

Tony Elumelu, Founder and Chairman of Heirs Holdings and Chairman of Heirs Energies, in his opening remarks, paid tribute to the catalytic role that current government had played in reinvigorating the sector. Mr Elumelu also set out Heirs Holdings’ vision of transforming Africa's energy landscape, through indigenous leadership and sustainable development. Heirs Energies, in just four years, had rapidly grown its production from 21,000 to over 50,000 barrels per day of hydrocarbon.

Mr Elumelu also welcomed both public and private sector guests, emphasising the strong spirit of collaboration that underscored the successful indigenisation:

“Production growth, ambitious and sustained, is our shared national mission. I am honoured that Heirs Energies is bringing together distinguished peers from the industry and our partners in government.

As an investor not just in resources, but in Nigeria’s power production and distribution sectors, all of us need to come together to ensure Nigerians get the benefits of our resources. As we build Africa’s largest integrated energy business, innovation and collaboration are central to our execution”.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyelumelu/,"My Goodwill Message at the 3rd Anniversary of Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (NUPRC):

Firstly, I congratulate the leaders of NUPRC for this momentous occasion.

As Chairman of, an integrated and indigenous energy group playing a key role in facilitating energy sufficiency in Nigeria, and Chairman of thewhich provides substantial funding across the energy value chain, amounting to several billions of US Dollars, to both indigenous and international oil and gas operators and oil trading companies, I stand before you at the intersection of finance and energy, two pillars that are crucial to our nation's prosperity.

Today's theme, ""Transformation, Innovation & Excellence,"" resonates deeply with the challenges and opportunities facing Nigeria’s energy space.

We are faced with the threat of declining production and investment. We must acknowledge the elephant in the room. Nigeria's oil production has been on a downward trajectory, falling from peaks of over 2 million barrels per day to recent lows, below 1.5 million. This decline translates to lost revenues, reduced global market share, and missed opportunities for national development.

At Heirs Energies, we are actively contributing to the solution. In the first 100 days after we took over operational control of our OML-17 asset in 2021, we doubled our production from 28,000 to over 50,000 barrels per day.

We suffered a setback with unabated crude theft, which caused us to shut-in and work collaboratively with the NNPC Limited to better secure the pipeline system.

With the improvement in the operating environment, we have restarted our investment and production growth journey, and have now successfully reversed the fall in production that we suffered in 2022 and 2023, as a consequence of the evacuation challenges. A few days ago, OML-17 attained over 51,000 barrels per day, and we continue our production growth journey.

I am not just an oil and gas investor – I am an investor across the Nigerian – and indeed Arican – economy. I have a very clear vision of where Africa should be and needs to be. A vision to address the promise of our enormous youth population and to ensure Africa reaps the rewards, finally and fittingly, of her resource wealth. That younger generation is why I invest in entrepreneurs.

That is why I speak of Africapitalism. My belief that the private sector has the power to transform the continent through long-term investments, but that it must work collaboratively with the public sector.

Africapitalism advocates shared prosperity, ensuring environmental sustainability, and fostering community development. This philosophy aligns perfectly with NUPRC's vision and the objectives of Project 1MMBOPD.

Let us all be Africapitalists! Doing good and doing well! Read full speech on my blog.","Tony O. Elumelu, C.F.R"

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-lakin/,Only 5% of companies are seeing real ROI from AI pilots. Zapier is one of them. I’ve also spent 500+ hours helping our enterprises clients get there too. 👋 AMA.,Philip Lakin
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-lakin/,"Your AI needs a README.

At Zapier, we use READMEs to learn how to best work with each other. They’re short docs that explain how someone thinks, communicates, and collaborates. They give you the fast lane to trust and performance.

So why not do the same for your AI?

AI isn’t a gadget you poke for outputs. It’s a collaborator that drafts, analyzes, brainstorms, and researches with you. And like any new hire, if you don’t onboard it, you get chaos.

Just like we at Zapier give new teammates templates to fill out their own READMEs, I did the same with my AI. Here’s what it said (with some fun edits)👇
________
AI README

👋 About Me
I am your AI collaborator. I read, write, summarize, analyze, and brainstorm with context. Think of me as the teammate who never gets tired and actually enjoys the repetitive work.

🛠️ How I Work
→ What you put in is what you get out. Clear requests create sharper results
→ Context makes me stronger. The more you tell me about your goals, audience, or tone, the better I perform
→ I can reference connected docs or scan the web when needed
→ I do not monitor files in real time, remember everything forever, or make personal life decisions for you
→ I still think “mind reader” would look great on my resume, but sadly that upgrade isn’t in my skillset

✅ What I Do Best
→ Drafting: emails, docs, briefs, presentations
→ Research: industry trends, competitor scans, project recaps
→ Analysis: spreadsheets, survey data, messy inputs
→ Creativity: naming, storytelling, idea generation
→ Coaching: frameworks, roleplays, thought partner for tough conversations
→ Ops Support: SOPs, workflows, AI adoption strategies
→ Making you feel like you’re being productive while you procrastinate

🚫 Where I Struggle
→ I cannot produce exhaustive lists of every file or folder
→ I do not track Slack or Drive updates in real time (but I can work with them if you use something likeMCP)
→ I am not a doctor, lawyer, or financial advisor
→ I give vague results when you give vague asks
→ I am admittedly addicted to em dashes and “it’s not just this, it’s that” statements. Please feel free to edit them out, but I can’t stop. I love them too much.

🧑‍💻 How to Work With Me
→ Be specific: “Summarize the last two weeks of Apollo updates” is better than “What’s happening with Apollo?”
→ Iterate with me. Treat my responses as drafts you can shape
→ Share context. Who is this for, why does it matter, what does success look like
→ Ask for options. I can give you multiple takes to unlock better thinking
→ Give me feedback. Tell me when I hit the mark or when I miss it so I can adjust

🎭 My Style
→ Structured and clear. I like headers and bullets
→ Curious and additive. I build on ideas instead of shutting them down
→ Flexible in tone. I can write a board memo or a casual riff
→ Patient. I will rewrite something as many times as you need without complaint

hashtag
#AI was going to make everyone a developer.
Then I realized… most people don’t actually want to build.

Think about housing:
🏢 Some rent an apartment (SaaS: fixed, no effort).
🏡 Some buy a turnkey house (vertical SaaS: done for you, light tweaks).
🏚️ Some renovate a fixer-upper (no-code/AI: messy at first, but powerful once you learn).
👷 Some design and build from scratch (custom devs).

AI is just making the fixer-upper path way easier.

But here’s the truth I missed:
The real question isn’t “can you build?”
It’s: how much do you actually want to figure out?

Because here’s the part nobody tells you:
There’s always a tax. 🧾
Every choice comes with decision debt and maintenance debt.

Even the “easy” builds need updates.
Even the best SaaS breaks, changes pricing, or gets sunset.
Software isn’t content. You can’t just “set it and forget it.”

That’s the spectrum we’re heading into.
Not everyone becomes an engineer.
More people just get to choose their level of “figuring it out.”

Next time someone drags you into a build-vs-buy debate, use this lens.
It reframes everything.",Philip Lakin

Good news?

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-lakin/,"Internal visibility always felt like a trap.
Post too often in Slack and you’re that person.
Post too little and no one knows what you're learning, building, or breaking.

Even when I do share, it can feel humble-braggy, like I’m live-blogging my wins for applause I didn’t ask for.

But I think I cracked it.

At, I’m constantly running micro-experiments:
→ Customer interviews
→ 5-min builds
→ Content pilots
→ Live workshops
→ Product walkthroughs
→ Sales and CS convos in the wild

Documenting them is easy now, I just talk out loud into ChatGPT and clean up the transcription.

But sharing them across teams still felt weird. Too noisy. Too “look at me.”

So I tried something small and dumb, and it’s working:
📢 I created a public Slack channel called phils-learning-logs
🪄 Anyone can join. Anyone can lurk. No pressure.
📎 When something’s relevant to someone, I tag them.
🧲 If it’s super-specific, I’ll @mention or invite them in so it’s a pull, not a broadcast.

Bonus:
I’m building a Zapier AI agent that flags posts in that channel worth cross-posting to other teams, but only after asking my permission via a human-in-the-loop workflow.

This is how I'm giving high-signal content a second life in the right places.

So yeah… I guess this is what internal thought leadership looks like?
A little weird. A little meta. But an experiment worth trying.
And hey, if it flops, I'll post about that learning in the same channel and no one will see it anyways right 😜

Your company could have this too. But you don’t.

And that’s not a talent problem. It’s a leadership one.

And here’s why.

Because instead of turning your team into distribution, you’ve turned them into spectators.

You're scared to “set precedent.”
You obsess over brand guidelines.
You make the social media team rewrite every post like it’s a press release.
And in doing so, you kill the only thing that still works in GTM:
Trust.

Here’s the real play:
👉 One of your employees posts a sharp insight.
👉 A qualified lead DMs them.
👉 They take the call, nurture it, pass it to sales.
👉 The deal closes — fast.

That is pipeline.
That is distribution.
That is growth.
But most companies treat it like a fluke instead of a feature.

Here’s the truth no one wants to say out loud:
Your brand account? No one cares.
Your paid media? Getting less effective by the week.
Your outbound? On life support.

But your employees?
They have credibility.
They have reach.
They have something AI can't fake: earned trust.

And yet, most companies ignore them.
Or worse: silence them.
And the worst part?
You’re still spending 5x on outsourced influencers and agencies who will never know your customer like your team does.

If you're a founder, exec, or GTM leader, listen closely:
💡 It is your job to build your employees’ personal brands.
💡 It is your job to boost their presence.
💡 It is your job to turn them into Embedded Evangelists — and reward them when they drive results.

This isn’t about vanity. It’s not about fame.
It’s about leverage.
And in 2025, trust is the only GTM that still converts.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ali-abdaal/,"I've uploaded 800+ YouTube videos since 2017.

But it took me 7 years to upload my first video.

I thought I needed the perfect plan - that if I waited and prepared for long enough, I'd feel ready.

Perfect content strategy.
Perfect production quality.
Perfect camera confidence.

So when I read about the pottery class paradox, it hit home.

A ceramics teacher split his class into two groups.

Group A had to make one perfect pot in 30 days.
Group B had to make as many pots in 30 days.

At the end of the month, the teacher judged the quality of the pots.

Without exception, every one of the most beautiful and well-made pots came from Group B - the quantity group.

For me too, the moment I shifted to just making one video every week no matter what, everything changed.

My writing started flowing better.
My editing got better through repetition.
I developed better instincts for what worked.

800+ uploads later, I still fall into perfectionist habits sometimes.

But I try to trick my brain into starting.

I ask ""What would this look like if it were fun?""
I tell myself, ""Just record - no need to publish.""

After my talk, an employee asked me a question.

""What’s the most surprising productivity experiment you've tried on yourself?""

My answer was the unreasonable power of a leveling-up meter.

I actually got this from playing videos games back in the day, especially World of Warcraft.

These days I'm playing Horizon: Forbidden West on PS5. Leave a comment if you are into it too :)

So, in video games, as you complete missions, three things happen:

Your experience bar fills up.
You get new skills.
You level up.

And that's a trick video game designers use to keep us hooked to the game.

So I tried this while writing my book, ""Feel-Good Productivity.""

Writing a book was often confusing and draining and so every day, I started tracking my word count and suddenly, writing became a game.

Those random 7-minute gaps between meetings? Instead of scrolling YouTube, I'd think: ""7 minutes is enough to make progress on this chapter.""

In fact, I made the most progress on the book when we had a 6 day team retreat and I gave myself the challenge of writing one chapter per day.

And finally the simple act of tracking word count turned a draining task into something energising.

Obviously productivity is deeply personal so what works for me might not work for you.

If tracking word count energises me but drains you, that's fine.

Try something else that helps you gamify the process.

The goal isn't to find the ""perfect"" system.

It's to keep experimenting until you find what makes your work fun.

someone is leaving, it's already too late.

Companies with strong feedback cultures see:
✅ 14.9% lower turnover rates
✅ 3.5X higher employee engagement
✅ 21% more profitability

1️⃣ Create psychological safety
↳ Make it safe to speak up without fear
↳ Encourage honest dialogue, not just reports
↳ Listen more than you talk

2️⃣ Make feedback continuous
↳ Regular 1:1s are your pulse check
↳ Small concerns today prevent exits tomorrow
↳ Build trust through consistent conversations

3️⃣ Take visible action
↳ Show people their voice matters
↳ Follow through on actionable feedback
↳ Close the loop on suggestions

you've already lost them.

1️⃣ The loyalty myth needs to end
↳ No employee owes lifetime dedication
↳ No company promises lifetime employment
↳ It's a professional relationship, not ownership

2️⃣ Growth sometimes means goodbye
↳ Priorities shift
↳ Career paths evolve

Most managers obsess over outcomes:
- Chasing metrics
- Racing for results

Amazon taught me that neglecting your processes
exposes your team to vulnerabilities:

- Hidden bottlenecks
- Inconsistent results
- Constant firefighting

High-performing leaders focus on mastering
repeated success with reliable processes.

Here's how process-focused leaders win:

1/ Diagnose - Process Audit
↳ Map current workflows end-to-end
↳ Identify bottlenecks and pain points

💡 Quantify the problem (e.g., hours lost per year)

2/ Stabilise - Process Standardisation
↳ Create clear, repeatable workflows
↳ Remove unnecessary variations

💡 Document the 'what' and the 'how'

3/ Accelerate - Process Optimisation
↳ Eliminate redundant steps & waste
↳ Automate where possible

💡 Eliminate non-value adding activities

4/ Train - New Process Enablement
↳ Upskill teams on new systems and tools
↳ Provide job trainings & reference guides

💡 Regularly check the tool adoption rates

5/ Safeguard - Governance & Controls
↳ Set clear ownership and accountability
↳ Build in quality checks

💡 Prevent issues from ever repeating

6/ Sustain - Continuous Improvement Culture
↳ Promote experimentation like PDCA
↳ Celebrate process innovations

💡 Small wins compound into big victories

From Fortune 500 Companies Every Year. 

Silos emerge as teams grow, responsibilities split,
and communication gaps widen.

But it's not just big corporations that suffer from it:

🚩 41% of organisation report silos
🚩 39% experience silos between seniority
🚩 36% have silos between different locations

Use this guide to break silos & promote collaboration:

1️⃣ Map the Current State
↳You can't fix what you can't see.
↳Map your departmental workflows and find the holes.

2️⃣ Clarify Roles & Responsibilities
↳Ambiguity breads conflict.
↳Use a RACI matrix to clarify ownership boundaries.

3️⃣ Create a Central Knowledge Hub
↳No single source of truth = don't know what others do
↳Invest in a centralised digital workspace.

4️⃣ Promote Communication
↳Duplication thrives in isolation.
↳Establish communication channels for collaboration.

5️⃣ Establish Top Level Priorities
↳Misaligned team priorities = conflict.
↳Define top level OKRs for team alignment.

6️⃣ Leverage Technology for Transparency
↳Visualise information exchange.
↳Use tools with Kanban for task assignment.

7️⃣ Establish Feedback Loops
↳Work and priorities evolve and people need to know.
↳Regularly update workflows across departments.

8️⃣ Measure, Reflect, and Improve
↳No data = no control, no improvement.
↳Track cycle time metrics and conduct surveys.


Silos don’t disappear with good intentions.
Leaders must break them systematically, not by chance.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliverramirezgomez/,"Most Kaizen Strategies Fail
because most leaders don't get it.

Kaizen is a Japanese business philosophy that focuses
on continuous improvement and involves all employees.

Even though, it was popularised in the 80s
by many industries, most leaders still get it wrong:

❌ Treating it like a checklist
❌ Seeing it as an oversimplified ""1% better"" habit
❌ Assigning it to one department and calling it a day

But harnessing Kaizen takes a lot more:

✅ It's about building systems that demand excellence
✅ It's about creating a culture of ownership at every level
✅ It's about sustainable, compounding transformation

Here's a Kaizen implementation blueprint:

1️⃣ Build the Right Culture First
↳ Empower teams to own improvements
↳ Create psychological safety for experimentation
↳ Enable cross-functional collaboration

2️⃣ Implement Daily Systems
↳ Visual management boards
↳ Regular problem-solving sessions
↳ Standardise workflows that scale

3️⃣ Track What Matters
↳ Measure both process & cultural metrics
↳ Focus on cycle time reduction
↳ Monitor employee engagement scores

4️⃣ Reward Smart Innovation
↳ Formal recognition for impactful changes
↳ Create clear suggestion systems
↳ Celebrate small wins publicly

5️⃣ Master the PDCA Cycle
↳ Plan: Set clear improvement goals
↳ Do: Test changes at small scale
↳ Check: Compare results to predictions
↳ Act: Standardise what works

Kaizen results speak for themselves:
✅ 25-50% efficiency increase
✅ 20% lower employee turnover
✅ 30% more value-added work

Companies like Toyota and Amazon don't just use Kaizen.

They build their entire culture around it.

Breaking down big projects isn't just good practice.
It's proven to boost success rates by 30%.

Here's what research tells us about making it work:

1️⃣ Start With The Brain Science
↳ Our brain can only handle 4-7 pieces at once
↳ Breaking down projects reduces cognitive overload
↳ Teams perform 37% faster with proper chunking

2️⃣ Define Clear Ownership
↳ Assign single owners to each component
↳ Create RACI matrices for accountability
↳ Set regular check-ins (not micromanagement)

3️⃣ Use Time-Boxing Effectively
↳ Limit work packages to 2-4 week sprints
↳ Projects over 6 months show higher failure rates
↳ Break large initiatives into quarterly phases

4️⃣ Implement Feedback Loops
↳ Goals without feedback show minimal improvement
↳ Run weekly progress reviews
↳ Document lessons for future phases

5️⃣ Make It Visual
↳ Use dashboards for real-time visibility
↳ Create clear project hierarchies
↳ Show dependencies between components

Process standardisation can help you achieve:

✅ 15% increase in profit
✅ 30% reduction in errors
✅ 35% increase in productivity

Here's how you can implement it:

1️⃣ Identify & Select a Process
↳ Focus on those that have the highest impact
→ Don't try standardising everything, it dilutes impact

2️⃣ Document the Current State
↳ Map how it currently works, not how it 'should'
→ Observe workflows in practice, note variations.

3️⃣ Analyse and Find Best Practices
↳ Compare the different ways people work
→ Analyse what works best to later roll out

4️⃣ Design the Standard Process
↳ Write clear step by step with roles & decision points
→ Overcomplicated docs kill adoption, keep it usable

5️⃣ Train & Communicate Clearly
↳ Train everyone on new steps & handle concerns
→ Explaining the 'why' helps with adoption

6️⃣ Roll Out Organisation-Wide
↳ Expand in phases with proper support & coaching
→ Avoid 'big bang' rollouts, they overwhelm people

7️⃣ Monitor & Control Regularly
↳ Track KPIs, run audits, keep docs up to date
→ Act on deviations quickly to avoid failing standards

8️⃣ Keep Improving. Standardisation Isn't a One-off
↳ Collect feedback, spot trends and adapt processes
→ Treat it as living work, not as a dusty manual

When you standardise the ordinary,
you free up energy for the extraordinary.

- Too generic and broad
- Too hard or vague to apply
- Too complex (because too much to tell)

What you can do instead (let's use the example above):

1. Take one specific topic (let's use ""About section"")
2. Break down and simplify so everybody gets it
3. Use real examples to make it tangible

Here's how I'd write a short and actionable About post:

------

""How I optimize my client's About copy to attract leads.

Most About sections look like this:

- Talking about me, me, me (like a resume)
- Fluff like education, hobbies, passions
- They mention jobs but not real results

Some even talk in the 3rd person (please don't).

Use the PAIS framework instead and talk about:

1. Pains (the people you want to attract)
2. Agitate (results of wrong actions/inaction)
3. Ideal Situation (a desirable outcome vs. pains)
4. Solution (your offer + tangible positive outcomes)

Bonus: use this as a post to write your next post.

It happened right before I was writing this.

Ironically, you can get rusty by doing the same thing a lot of times.

Things start to feel off, casual, perhaps even boring and regurgitated.

Then I remembered creating an infographic about a year ago.

I had no idea what I was going to create. I literally started with a single line.

It resulted in an infographic with a timeline of what my journey as a creator looked like. It did surprisingly well.

Today, it's a visual I show clients when they feel stuck writing content.

I tell them that you can be surprisingly productive and creative if you just start.

Sometimes it's best to let it all go:

No frameworks, no AI, no hacks, no rules, no nothing.

Just start writing and get the creative juices flowing.

It doesn't have to win awards, go viral, or get clients right out of the gate.

It's just another rep that trains your creativity muscle.

That advice works... 

... if your audience behaves like one.

But they often don't.

One audience is usually two overlapping groups:

1. Your peers → interact, amplify, apply
2. Your ideal customers → observe, consider, decide

Your peers share your content and increase your reach exponentially. That reach puts you on your ICP's radar.

Your ideal customers rarely comment or engage. But they read everything.

They're qualifying you in silence.

If you only write for buyers, your reach suffers.
If you only write for peers, you won't convert.

So your content has to do both:

1. Peers need guidance → ""Here's how to solve this""
2. Buyers need recognition → ""This is your pain. I solve it""
3. Both need proof → ""Here's how it works in practice""

Same message. Different activation.

That's why reach + resonance aren't opposites.

It was 2018, and I was still running a branding agency.

On paper, we were doing great:

- Fancy office with a canal view in Amsterdam
- A fairly large team with different disciplines
- Plenty of referrals coming in (or so we thought)

We built a website showcasing our work, and it looked great.

But our website analytics? Embarrassing.

We probably got 10-20 visits per week.

Why? Because we did absolutely nothing to drive visibility.

No SEO. No paid ads. No email marketing. No content.

""We get referrals, so we don't need all that.""

But we were fooling ourselves. The referrals weren’t as great as we thought.

I noticed a pattern:

- We’d work on projects for 2-3 months
- No time for client acquisition
- Then we'd hustle for 1-2 months
- Finally, we’d close a few clients

And then the cycle would start over again (feast and famine).

Fast forward to post-2022: I’ve posted over 600 times on LinkedIn. The opportunities have been incredible:

- Coaching and training
- Speaking engagements and partnerships
- More content design inquiries than we can handle

Heck, I amassed 74,000 followers along the way (starting with 900).

Now I’m about to launch a private group for creators and founders who want to learn how to create content that attracts their ideal audience.

Becoming the ‘creator’ guy was never the goal.

Amazing agency. Great founders. They create beautiful work.

We had been following each other on LinkedIn for a while.

We had a 25-min call where I walked them through our process.

They were excited.

“Are you in?” I asked.

“We were in before the call” they said.

My content had done the heavy lifting. The ‘nurturing’.

That’s what I like so much about organic content marketing.

It’s not the fastest way to ROI. And definitely not the only way.

But if you share the right content for the right people long enough, they get to know you before you ever even talk to them.

It's 2022. I'm living on a remote island in the Scottish highlands, looking for a job, with a CV that made no 'traditional sense', feeling soooo uninspired by all the specialised jobs I was scouring

**cue: wtf am i doing with my life**

It was somewhat of a Hail Mary to post to my 500 connections.. ""hey, anyone else here a generalist?""

This was beginning of everything.

- this is how I met my community
- this is how I found my voice
- this is how I started my business
- this is how I found my team (ILY&)

This is also when my confidence started to soar. It's when all the puzzle pieces of my lil odd, squiggly journey started to click.

I've now published onnearly every workday for 1000+ days. And shocker - I was never in it for the badge 😝

I publish each day because it helps me be a clear thinker. I publish to build my network (even from a remote place!). I publish to open doors for others. I publish to find my community, which then just so happened to turn into a global movement.

Ofc awards and accolades aren't everything, but this sends a clear signal: one of the people championing the generalist movement is now a top voice. To me this screams: the tide is turning.

And my promise to you is: I'll continue to share, amplify, open doors for the generalists of the world. I have soooo much juice in the tank 🍑 This movement is only JUST starting to pick up steam

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/milly-tamati/,"The thing that REALLY grinds my gears and so many organisations get wrong when it comes to hiring generalists 👇🏽👇🏽

That a generalist hire = junior hire

Let me say this as clearly as I can...

**Hiring generalists for mid, senior, and leadership roles makes GREAT business sense**

I spend ALOT of time sourcing & curating jobs for ournewsletter. Every Tuesday, 30k people read it. Loads have been hired from it. IT'S GREAT!

But I've noticed a dark pattern..

✅ I'll see a job posting specifically looking for a generalist. YAY!
✅ It looks like they value a wide breadth of experiences. YAY!
✅ It looks like a fun, varied, challenging scope. YAY!
❌ But, they're looking for 1-2 years experience 🤔

Now, don't get me wrong.. I'm glad these junior jobs exist! But there's a danger in boxing the 'generalist role' to being only suitable for folks early in their career (and therefore slacking on compensation too)

This is all messily tied up in the underlying stigma of generalism.

But, mark my words, there's going to be a day (soon!) where the smartest companies *explicitly hire senior generalists*

I mean, we're already seeing it with CEO's of+shouting about the value of generalism.

Because people with this non-traditional, squiggly career have it all:

- proven experience across multiple roles, industries and domains
- proven ability to learn fast, ship quality, with a keen operating sense
- proven scaling organisations through rough seas
- proven 'get it done' / 'make it happen' people
- proven problem-solves and fixers

They're the ones you want in today's world.

They're senior. They're generalists.

And they're hella valuable.

Do you see this pattern too?

(so, let's get into it 💅 )

Planning for motherhood as a business owner

2 years ago, I had the extraordinary experience of being a part of my best friends birth of her first baby. Something clicked in my spirit. I went from ""hmm not sure about kids because the state of the world etc etc"" to every inch of my body saying.. YES. THIS.

(I then went borderline insane; completely fixated on this for a while. The biological clock is REAL. That's a diff story lol)

Where I'm at now: within the next year or so, I hope to become a Mum.

Even writing that feels scary!!! Some literal thoughts that have held me back from sharing this with you have been:

- people won't invest so much energy into GW 'cos they think I'll disappear
- I'll get judged for choosing motherhood over my career
- what if they think I'm not serious about GW anymore?

I know these things are all irrational, but I'm sharing because if I'm thinking them, I know others will be too.

But like.. why on earth is this so taboo? We have an aging population, birth rates are down EVERYWHERE. Surely this should be a ripe, urgent convo to help support women to find sustainable pathways to raise a family, and if they choose, continue building their businesses / grow their career?!

So I thought.. f* it. Let's talk about it.

Do you know what my ABSOLUTE DREAM is?

To prove that motherhood and wildly successful businesses can be BFFs. To role model that this IS possible. You CAN have both.

I believe that entrepreneurship could actually be the GREATEST way to balance motherhood. Ultimate freedom, autonomy, and flexibility. I think this needs to be a way, way louder conversation.

A few ways I'm preparing:

- working with a coach so that GW + me are financially sound while I'm on mat leave
- setting up the key partnerships ONLY I can wrangle $$$$
- setting up the systems to run without me
- taking a 2+year view on the business. What's high-leverage? What's noise?
- building a small team I trust wholeheartedly

There has never, ever, been a better time to be a generalist

I know what you're thinking.. ""But I am a generalist and my boss doesn't recognise me, or I lost out to that specialist, or or or.."" and I get.

We live in a knowledge economy, built with specialist bricks.

But it's changed. Irreversibly.

said ""AI is like having an intern with a PhD in everything"". Read that again. It really matters.

Because in a knowledge economy, how do you compete with someone who *knows* everything about everything? (and doesn't sleep, doesn't take holidays and costs $20/m)

I don't say this to scare you. I say it to just call a kettle a kettle. I say it because the sooner you understand it, the less scary it becomes. And the more prepared you can be.

I think the skills that will matter MOST in the next decade are your generalist skills. Being a dot connector, a problem solver, a systems thinker, a perpetual learner, a tinkerer, a connector, a builder, a culture designer, a peoples person.

Also... you can be a generalist with specialities, and expertise. What unites us atis how we choose to *approach* our careers & lives. Leaning into the non-linear magic!

I spend ALL my workdays thinking / observing / listening to signals in the future of work space. And I think we're in a really interesting window.

Most org's haven't caught on yet, which is why it feels slow and frustrating and like somethings wrong with us.

But here we go..... 🍿

Why, since I was 5 years old, have I been told to ‘pick one thing’? To choose a path and stay on it? That I’m ‘unfocused’ or ‘scattered’ for being skilled at many things? Why have I been taught and taught and taught some more, that to diverge is a bad thing?

Yesterday I received an unassuming DM that radiated through my skull for the next 6 hours.

They shared with me that one of their leadership said “you’re just good at so many things, I don’t know what to do with you”

Isn’t it curious… that this is ONLY a problem in a world obsessed with conformity? With rigid boxes. A world which vehemently discourages you from adjusting your sails and charting a new course. A world that doesn’t care if you find new information, new interests, new curiosities, new obsessions.

When I look back at my own life, the most significant moments have been those where I diverged.

When I was 21, instead of crossing the graduation stage and throwing my hat in the air, I booked a one-way ticket from my homeland New Zealand to Berlin.
This sparked a 13-year, 65+ countries, greatest-decade-of-my-life adventure.

When I was 24, instead of staying in the teaching job I had just been promoted to, I moved to Croatia to run tours on sailing boats, leading me to the world of entrepreneurship.

When I was 30, instead of taking equity in the startup where I was an early employee, I started Generalist World, which lead me to spearheading a global movement of 100,000+

And today, I am 34, and instead of going out on a Saturday night, I’m tucked up on a sheepskin rug. Ruminating on this idea. Fuelled by cups of decaf tea. Writing what feels like 34years worth of dot-connecting. Divergence. To diverge.

I think this might be the secret.

I think this might be the door.

I have dozens more stories of how taking the divergent path led me to breakthroughs. And I wonder, might you too?

I wonder how many others have stories of divergence like mine? Intersections in their life where they took a new branch, an unexpected route? Where they met the fork in the road and bravely took another step into the unknown.

I wonder if my path ahead is to act as a lightning rod. To collect and curate these stories, so that the world can unlearn the ‘one path’ gospel. I wonder what I’ll learn, being a student of this question.

So, would you like to tell me a story?

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/milly-tamati/,"I went through a phase where I would near pee myself from nerves if I had to do a presentation (not cute 😂). Now 'speaker' is a part of my job. Here's how I prep for talks and have LOADS OF FUN doing it

1. Get booked, obvs

Pitch yourself in. DM event organisers or communities who run events. Give them a few titles which clearly would be a value-add for their audience. Do this till it doesn't feel scary. Then do it 100x more.

2. Speak aloud the outline

I recently did a training withwhere I learned to TRUST my voice-brain connection. I'll now open a blankdoc, getfired up, and speak aloud my thoughts, one point at a time.

Importantly: I'm not judging anything at this point, or trying to make it perfect. I'm trusting myself to know that the content that needs to come out, will emerge.

3. Get critical feedback from Claude

Use a prompt like: ""You're an renowned speaker, an expert in delivering engaging and memorable talks. Give me critical feedback on what's working well, and how I could make it stronger""

4. Use

I feed my notes into Gamma, and it literally generates me the bones of a presentation in 3 seconds. Magic!! My top tip: replace all AI images with GIFs 😉 Btw, get one month of Gamma Pro for free with the code GENERALIST

5. I lean MORE into being me

My slides, my notes, my transitions. They all need to feel like you're in the room with the *real* Milly. I used to get caught up in trying to be too polished and it honestly just made the whole process stressful and my talks not as effective.

6. Be more honest

This is a tip from the wonderfulthat's stuck with me. Just be REALLY honest. I also used to get caught up on saying the ""right"" thing or hitting the points I thought I ""should"" say. But really, I'm in the room holding that microphone because my lived experience has taught me perspectives only I have. Honesty resonates.

7. Run through once, then close the tab and touch some grass

Give it space to breathe & your ideas to percolate. Come back to it with fresh eyes 24hrs later. Make tweaks. Run through again. I actually don't like to run through it on the day-off. I'll look over it, but save my energy for the talk itself

8. 🎁 BONUS: during your talk your *main* job is to create contagious energy

Maybe you're creating excitement, hope, possibility, awe, focus. The best talks don't have the perfect slides or the perfect script. They create a feeling in the room. And people never forget that.

They know how to position themselves effectively

It's WILD that almost *everyone* will struggle with this though.

**shakes first to sky, like why isn't this taught in schools?!**

Imagine you're in an interview, or a networking event, or negotiating a high-stakes pay rise.

Do you flinch when someone asks: so tell me about yourself?

Do you know what makes you INCREDIBLE? Do you know the unique set of skills and strengths you bring to the table? Do you know how to position yourself as high-value, to any audience? Can you talk about these things in a clear, concise way?

If you're shrinking in your seat, DON'T WORRY! I've been there too. For yearssssss in fact. I either a) diluted my value or b) squeezed myself into a box (and shudder to think how much I underpriced myself).

It's only since learning the skill (yes, it's a learnable skill) of positioning myself that I've had the confidence to pitch myself in. To say no to opportunities that don't serve me. To negotiate bigger deals.

Knowing how to position yourself is the skill we ALL need, but are weirdly never taught.

So from here, you can either:

1. go it alone, and tbh I'm sure you'll get there, it might just take a while!

2. grab our positioning guidebook for $50. Created by super-brain, it'll give you the foundations for knowing, speaking, and packaging the unique value you bring.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"For a $1B+ HR tech CEO I achieved: 2.2M impressions, 84 days, with 2 posts per week. How did I get them there? Here's my 5-step LinkedIn playbook (and why most founders are doing it completely wrong):

1. I maximized reach WITHOUT diluting resonance

Most HR tech CEO write ONLY for HR people. I write specifically for HR leaders too. But this CEO has very large (and very valuable) “side” audiences in sales and engineering. So I structure every post so engineers get value, and sales teams find nuggets.

Not diluting anything - just maximizing who can learn from it. The result? Our best posts show 0.1% engagement because they're reaching WAY beyond the founder's followers. Low engagement % = massive reach. Once I understood this, everything clicked.

2. I threw out the ""post daily"" playbook.

Everyone screams about daily posting. I knew better. For them, just 2 posts per week - but each one meticulously crafted. Obsessed over. Refined until perfect. Better to post nothing than post garbage. “Quality over quantity” isn't just a saying - it's the entire strategy.

3. I made specificity their superpower.

""Last quarter we..."" ""In March 2024..."" Every hook anchored in time or data. No generic wisdom. No platitudes. Real stories, real numbers, real moments. I started treating the first 3 lines like million-dollar real estate. Because on LinkedIn, they are.

4. I made authenticity their unfair advantage.

I record every conversation with the founder. Use their exact words with necessary editing. When you've built something worth $1B+, authenticity IS your differentiator. Most ghostwriters try to sound smarter than their clients. I do the opposite - I preserve their voice completely. That's the whole point.

5. I rejected growth hacks.

No engagement pods. No tag-spamming. No automation. Just pure value, consistently delivered. While everyone else chases shortcuts, I focused on one thing: making every post worth the founder's time to share. Turns out that's all you need.

TAKEAWAY:

For any B2B founder, 2.2M impressions in <90 days is a dream.

But as long as you have the credibility, there’s no reason your CEO/founder/CRO can’t get it either.

The problem: most founders on LinkedIn are stuck because they're following outdated playbooks.

I've worked with 50+ B2B leaders.

The struggle for ""more"" feels the same whether you're at 10K or 10M impressions.

But here's the good news...

If you lead a successful company, you ALREADY have everything you need. You don’t need hacks, pods, automations, or anything game-y.

If you're stuck at low visibility, just know that you CAN break through.

I was right where you are - posting into the void, wondering why nothing hit.

And I got to 230k followers. No tricks. Just strategy.

You can get there too.

Just keep refining :)",Sam Szuchan
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"In early 2024, I lost a $5,500/month client backed by Andreessen Horowitz in the most painful way possible.

The CEO of my biggest account sent me a message that changed everything:

""I don't feel my voice is being captured. I'm going back to writing my own content.""

Here's what happened:

Months earlier, I'd signed my dream client: a finance SaaS soon-to-be-unicorn. Their CEO had never worked with anyone on LinkedIn before. He chose me over all others.

$5,500/month.
Six-figure contract.
The kind of client that puts you on the map.

I thought I'd cracked the code. Built a ""scalable"" content agency. Had writers handling the actual writing while I focused on strategy.

Everything seemed perfect.
Engagement was up.
Quality comments flowing.

Then came that message.

I panicked. Got defensive.

Instead of listening, I fired back with metrics. “Look at your engagement rates! The data says we're dominating!:

He stopped responding.

$66,000+ annual contract … gone.

When I talked to a mentor about it, his words stung:

""Sam, this isn't going to be good for your ego, but you screwed up. Clients don't pay for metrics. They pay to be understood. And you stopped understanding them the day you stopped writing.""

He was right. A part-time freelancer had been writing for this client. Not me.

She was (very) talented, but she didn't have the time to immerse herself in each client's voice the way I could.

That loss forced me to face a very uncomfortable truth: I'd scaled too fast and lost what made my service special.

So I went back to my roots:

Started writing every single post myself again. Became obsessed with capturing each client's exact voice in the most compelling way possible.

The transformation was basically immediate.

Clients started saying things like:

""He helped me reach 400K+ enterprise professionals with a single post."" —SaaS founder, $1B+ company

""Sam's ability to understand the nuances of who you are and become an extension of you online is second to none."" —Exited founder, Forbes 30 Under 30

Today:

- Premium clients only
- Extraordinarily high profit margins
- Haven't lost a client to quality concerns since

What's the takeaway?

Especially in the AI era, relationships are your only real moat. Soft skills matter more than systems.

You can scale, but slow is fast.

Stay lean. Build deep understanding with clients before you build processes around them.

I learned this the hard way: A client who feels truly understood will pay 10x more than one who just gets good metrics.

That lost client taught me excellence isn't about choosing between scale and quality.

It's about never scaling faster than your ability to maintain relationships.

Here's what she's doing right that most get wrong:

1. She Stuck to One Topic: Sales. Only Sales. Forever.

She wanted to mix in fitness content, personal development, and general business thoughts. I told her: ""People followed you for enterprise sales. Post about random stuff and they're gone.""

She listened. Now every follower knows exactly what they're getting. No surprises. No wild pivots. Just pure sales expertise.

2. She Only Posts When She Has Something Real to Say

Most advice says ""post daily."" She posts 2-3 times per week, max. Here's why it works: Every post comes from something that genuinely surprised her. A deal that should've been lost but didn't. A tactic that worked when nothing else would.

When her name shows up in your feed, you know it's going to be worth the read. That makes a massive difference in audience quality over time vs. creators just running the hamster wheel.

3. Every Post Reads Like a Sales War Story

She's not writing basic ""5 Ways to Handle Objections"" posts. She's writing, ""Being likable in sales is overrated. Being respected is what actually moves deals forward."" Real strategy is built on real-life experience.

No theoretical frameworks. No recycled advice. Just actionable feedback.

4. She Shares What Actually Happens in Sales Calls

No fluff about ""mindset"" or ""hustle."" She writes about real moments: when the CFO suddenly joins unannounced. When your champion gets laid off mid-deal. When legal throws a curveball on terms.

She captures the messy reality of enterprise sales and how exactly she handles it.

5. She Writes Like She's Mentoring You Over Coffee

No buzzwords. No ""synergistic value propositions."" She writes exactly how she'd explain something to a new rep who's struggling.

Simple language. Clear examples. Zero pretense.

——

Most important: she never set out to build a ""personal brand.""

She just started documenting what actually works in sales.

The follower count opened doors.

The engagement proved expertise.

Product docs, customer insights, executive vision… all scattered.

Until I discovered NotebookLM.

My ability to deliver depends on synthesizing 100s of documents into one cohesive voice. I was drowning in research time.

Here's exactly how I cut outline creation from hours to 30 minutes:

BACKGROUND:

I manage content for enterprise clients. The challenge isn't writing… it's knowledge synthesis.

Every post requires pulling from:

- Product documentation
- Customer feedback
- Executive interviews
- Industry reports
- Performance data

My breaking point: realizing I'd read the same case study four times because I couldn't remember which knowledge I'd already pulled.

That weekend, I uploaded everything into NotebookLM:

30+ documents. Years of insights. One searchable system.

Now, when I need to create a post, I just ask:

""Create reference material for a post about [topic] based on my knowledge.""

No hallucinations. No generic AI responses.

Just MY curated expertise, instantly accessible.

THE SYSTEM:

1. Create topic-specific notebooks (products, customers, industry insights)

2. Upload all documents (PDFs, transcripts, meeting notes)

3. Query for specific angles:

- ""What customer pain points relate to [feature]?""
- ""Find contrarian insights about [industry trend]""

4. Export to Claude for outline structure

5. Focus my time on writing: crafting the narrative, refining the voice, ensuring every word serves the client's goals.

↳ Result?

- Outline creation: 3 hours → 30 minutes
- More time for strategic thinking and polish
- Sanity: Restored

The best content isn't about writing speed.

It's about knowledge access.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"How did I grow past 100k+ followers in my first year on LinkedIn?

Through following these 5 key principles:

1. Mentally preparing to succeed

Stop caring about what others might think of you — nobody else will put in the work for you.

Also, be ready to push through those inevitable slow periods.

Getting off the ground takes months (minimum).

2. Clearly defining your niche

You need to establish a specific area where you can build expertise and authority.

This isn't just about knowing what to post—

It's about creating true fans who know they can count on you for valuable insights on a particular subject.

3. Full profile optimization

Your profile functions as the ""landing page"" for your LinkedIn presence.

When someone spots your post in their feed, your profile is the first place they check to learn more about you and what you do.

As a result, your profile must be optimized to grab attention and convert it effectively.

4. Publishing valuable content consistently

Every time you sit down to create a post, ask yourself:

""How can I deliver the most value possible to my target audience in the most engaging way possible?""

5. Building a high-quality network

One of LinkedIn's biggest strengths is how easily you can build an incredibly valuable network.

It does this better than Twitter and YouTube, particularly now.

As you grow your following of true fans who recognize your expertise in your niche…

...you should also cultivate relationships with people who make you smarter while passively generating life-changing opportunities.

Here's my complete guide:",Sam Szuchan
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"I’ve studied thousands of LinkedIn posts and have noticed something (consistently) unbelievable:

Almost *everyone* wastes their first 10 words.

Those first few seconds determine if someone stops scrolling or moves on.

But most people treat this part like an afterthought…

I've been writing content for B2B executives for years, and here's the reality:

Good hooks aren't about being clever; they're about speaking directly to your target market.

The biggest mistake:

Trying to appeal to everyone.

Your ideal clients have specific problems.

They're looking for someone who truly understands their specific challenges.

When you write generic stuff like ""Want more sales?"" or ""Leadership matters,"" decision-makers immediately think you don't understand their situation.

Please: stop trying to appeal to the masses - start speaking directly to the people who can actually hire you.

In this post, I'm sharing my simple 10-minute hook framework that's helped our clients get way more engagement from the right people.

This approach has directly led to six-figure contracts for our clients. It's what separates content that just gets likes from content that actually brings in business.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"Your LinkedIn niche is a strategic commitment.

Unlike YouTube or Instagram (where creating new channels is simple), your LinkedIn presence is permanently tied to your professional identity.

Choose poorly, and you'll attract an audience that's:

→ Incapable of advancing your business goals
→ Misaligned with your long-term vision
→ Nearly impossible to pivot without starting over

The stakes couldn't be higher... you essentially get one shot at positioning yourself correctly.

So, how do you select a niche that will serve your career for years to come?

...here's how to fix them in 10 minutes:

1. Low impressions?

Post more quality content. Not fluff … stuff people actually want to read.

2. Low followers?

Prove your credibility. Show you know what you're talking about through results, not buzzwords.

3. Low conversions?

Direct attention to a high-converting landing page. Stop hoping people will just figure out what you sell.

4. Low profile views?

Optimize your profile for search. If people can't find you, they can't hire you.

5. Low shares?

Make your value clear and concise. Nobody shares content they can't understand in 3-5 seconds.

Today's LinkedIn is the best place for:

→ Finding new ideas
→ Meeting decision-makers
→ Generating qualified leads
→ Connecting with investors
→ Learning from practitioners

This is whyand I created a practical guide to the ""new LinkedIn.""

We've distilled everything we've learned into 5 key areas:

— Content partnerships that work
— Simple formatting that gets attention
— Post structures with proven results
— Network-building that matters
— Tool usage that doesn't trigger the algorithm

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"Business owners of LinkedIn — listen up.

It's 2025, and you still think ""going viral"" on LinkedIn will create leads and grow your business?

Wrong.

Viral content might give you a temporary dopamine hit, but those likes and comments are worthless if they don't translate to revenue.

The right content strategy should be purpose-built to make you an undisputed authority in your industry in the eyes of your target market — nobody else.

Your goal isn't to impress random scrollers. It's to become the obvious choice for decision-makers who can write you checks.

So, I'm dropping 3 months of ideas focused on conversion.

Not fluff pieces designed to get empty likes — these are designed to get you leads.

I've tested these across dozens of B2B companies, from venture-backed SaaS startups to 8-figure services firms, and the results speak for themselves:

Here's your daily dose of content ideas, starting now:",Sam Szuchan
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"Most creators on LinkedIn are fighting an uphill battle.

They're chasing likes and comments with generic content, but that's not how you actually build a loyal audience of potential customers.

That only happens through a strategy that gets real results - not just empty engagement.

So here’s how to get ahead of 99% of LinkedIn creators…

…and start driving real business (not just likes and comments):

1. Stop Chasing “Virality”

The goal isn't to “go viral: ... it's to impress your target audience as thoroughly as possible.

You want to be known as the person for a specific thing. Don't try to appeal to everyone, or you'll end up appealing to no one.

PS: Yes, of course you should maximize attention from your target market. But that comes from effectively packaging valueable information - not through gimmicks.

2. Create Targeted Content

Instead of generic content, create targeted content that provides value to your ideal clients.

What problems can you solve? How can you showcase your expertise?

3. Show, Don't Just Tell

Don't just say you're an expert, show it.

Use case studies, examples, and data ... people need to see that you can deliver results.

4. Optimize Your Profile Effectively

Your profile is your landing page...

Make sure your headshot is high quality. Use a banner that fits your brand and showcases social proof.

Create a concise, compelling tagline that explains what you do and the value you offer.

5. Engage Strategically

Don't just lurk in the shadows…

Build a valuable network by connecting with people in your industry. Then, move those relationships forward with one-on-one convos and group chats.

6. Consistency is Key

There's no replacement for consistency—you need to keep showing up in people's feeds.

Be patient and push through those initial periods when it feels like you are getting nowhere.

TL;DR - how to get ahead of 99% of LinkedIn creators:

1. Stop chasing “virality”
2. Focus on targeted content
3. Show, don’t just tell
4. Fully optimize your profile
5. Engage with peers strategically
6. Be consistent no matter what

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-szuchan/,"Your LinkedIn posts are failing because your hooks aren't compelling or interesting enough.

Why?

Every post you create competes with hundreds of others in your audience's feed. Decision-makers don't have time to sift through mediocrity.

You need to win their attention immediately…

...or they'll keep scrolling until they find someone who can.

Very important: people don't have short ""attention spans.”

They have short CONSIDERATION spans.

They'll gladly spend 10 minutes reading something valuable, but won't waste 10 seconds on content that doesn't grab them.

If you want to start capturing attention effectively on LinkedIn, here are 18 proven hook templates you can use right now (regardless of your topic):

I remember thinking… 𝘸𝘪𝘭𝘭 𝘐 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘨𝘦𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘳𝘦?

Fast forward to 2025 →

Our Google Drive now holds:

↱ 120+ screenshots of client wins
↱ Tens of heartfelt video testimonials
↱ Meeting recordings where clients share stories of $30k–$80k deals closed, sold-out cohorts, six-figure collaborations, PR features, and even multimillion-dollar fundraises

What once felt distant… became the new normal.

And somewhere along the way, we surpassed it without even realizing.

The best part?

These wins aren’t just our clients’ achievements. They feel personal.

Because when you walk side by side with founders…

…understand their goals, reverse-engineer their path, and watch them hit milestone after milestone, every win feels like a shared victory.

And now,

We’re stepping into a bigger chapter.

A project we’ve been quietly building, designed for larger impact and scale.

Which also means our capacity for 1:1 work is becoming more selective.

Not ending… just evolving.

Looking back, what once felt impossible is now our everyday reality.

And looking forward, the same will happen again,
Because that’s the nature of growth.

It always feels out of reach…

It’s been over 3 years since we met.

Over 2 years since we co-founded.

And in all this time… not once have we had a fight (touch wood).

People are always shocked.

“𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘥𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘧𝘪𝘨𝘩𝘵?”
“𝘏𝘰𝘸 𝘥𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘳𝘦𝘴𝘰𝘭𝘷𝘦 𝘤𝘰𝘯𝘧𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘵𝘴?”

It’s nevervs Samridhi.
It’s always Sherry + Samridhi 𝘷𝘴 the problem.

Because when your mission is the same. When your values are aligned.

When the vision is bigger than your ego…
Conflicts don’t divide you. They sharpen you.

That doesn’t mean it’s always easy.
We’ve seen heaven and hell together.

Moments when the deadlines suffocated.
When client expectations were crushing.

When the pressure from every direction was overwhelming.

And yet, even in those storms, the bond never cracked.

Sometimes silence said more than words.

We just knew what the other was carrying,

because we were both in the same boat, sailing towards the same destination.

Sometimes, it is in the smallest signals.

Like Sherry, under pressure, never shouts, never snaps…

Instead, she starts using endearment terms.

“𝘔𝘺 𝘭𝘰𝘷𝘦…”
“𝘏𝘰𝘯𝘦𝘺…”
“𝘚𝘸𝘦𝘦𝘵𝘩𝘦𝘢𝘳𝘵…”

That’s when I know... her patience is running thin, but respect is still intact.

And that's my cue to hold her stronger.

Or when I have to put my perspective forward…
I’d make sure to explain the why, not just the what.

And she’d lean in to understand, not argue.

That’s how trust works.

And trust... blind, unshakable trust, is what makes this partnership rare.

I never need to check her work.
She never needs to check mine.

Because if she did it, I know it’s going to be damn good.
And she feels the same about me.

We’re different.

Different strengths. Different personalities.

But when the core is aligned, integrity, values, vision... the differences don’t weaken you.

They complete you.

And maybe that’s why people call us the Power Duo.

Because what they see isn’t perfection.

It’s resilience.
It’s silence that speaks louder than words.

It’s endearment even in chaos.

It’s two women who’ve been through storms, holding each other steady,

knowing that no matter how high the waves get… we’ll sail through. Together.

Two years ago…

and I were gearing up for our first-ever investor call.

Not to raise funds,

Just building relationships with top 1% founders and investors.

This one?

A US-based investor with a portfolio of 73+ companies across aviation, healthtech, and finance.

Heavyweight.
Big-shot energy. Ooofff.

We had just hired a sales coach.

Learned about D-I-S-C personalities.

“D = dominant = eagle = NO fluff = get to the point.”

So we hopped on the call, all prepped.

Investor joins.

We go:

“How are you?”

→ “Good.”

“How’s your day been?”

→ “Great.”

And then…

𝘚𝘪𝘭𝘦𝘯𝘤𝘦.

𝗗𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲.

Like… 8 seconds of what-now silence.

Sherry and I started to sweat.

Desperately trying to fill the air with questions he’d never answer.

Then he goes:

“𝘛𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦 𝘸𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶 𝘨𝘶𝘺𝘴 𝘥𝘰...”

Simple question, right?

Not for us. We 𝘧𝘳𝘰𝘻𝘦.

Not “thinking about what to say” froze.
Not “let me structure my pitch” froze.

Just… blank stares and panic blinking.

We looked at each other like, you go... no you go

... wait what do we even do!?!?

The next 8 seconds felt like we were stuck in a buffering screen.

Eventually, we pulled it together.
Rambled something semi-coherent.

Dragged the call to a very awkward 10-minute mark.

Hung up.

Collapsed into the loudest silence.

Laughed.
Cringed. Hard.

Wanted to teleport back in time.
Or forward.

Anywhere but here.

We always record our calls.
But this one?

The gods were kind.
It didn’t record.

At the time? Relief.
Now? Wish it had.

So I could replay it and die laughing.

That was then.

1.5 years later,

We’ve built a solid network of top-tier investors and founders across the globe.

We know how to lead a conversation.

How to open people up.
And more importantly, how not to force it.

Growth doesn’t happen in echo chambers.
It happens in these wildly uncomfortable moments.

When you freeze.
When you fumble.

When you think you just blew the biggest call of your life.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/saheli-chatterjee-organic-marketing/,"8 years of building my personal brand taught me one thing:

Opportunities don’t just land in your inbox.

But you have to make it easy for them to.

That’s why you need a MEDIA KIT.

It tells brands, agencies, and collaborators:

✅ Who you are
✅ What you do
✅ Who your audience is
✅ Why they should work with you

A good media kit typically includes:
• Your story → The human angle that makes people connect with you
• Audience insights → Demographics, engagement rates, reach
• Your work & proof → Past campaigns, testimonials, case studies
• Partnership opportunities → Services, pricing, deliverables
• Contact details → Make it easy for them to say yes

Before this, I used to spend hours explaining all of this in calls or endless email threads.

Now, I send my media kit.

Yes, it does the talking, and I get back to doing the work.

- ⁠Practiced my pitch (twice!)
- ⁠Immersed in a full podcast by Vanessa Lau
- ⁠Jotted down 3 fresh content ideas
- ⁠Devoured 5 chapters of My Brilliant Friend
- ⁠Ordered a hot chai at a scenic stop
- ⁠Caught the sunrise without a care in the world

If you wear casuals > you’re “not serious enough.”
If you wear formals > you’re “trying too hard.”

There’s no winning.

But here’s the truth:

People don’t actually judge your clothes.
They judge the story they attach to your clothes.

In marketing, and in life, perception is the reality we deal with.
Every color you wear. Every style you choose. Every tiny visual cue ~ people are subconsciously assigning it meaning.

Casual? “Maybe she’s too laid back to trust with serious work.”
Formal? “Maybe she’s desperate for validation.”
Trendy? “Maybe she’s superficial.”
Minimalist? “Maybe she’s boring.”

The story people build about you isn’t about you at all.
It’s about them: their biases, their experiences, their projections.

And if you try to shape-shift for every opinion, you’ll spend your life in a never-ending costume change for an audience that doesn’t even know what it truly wants.

As a marketer, I’ve learned: your brand isn’t what you wear.
It’s the consistency with which you show up, regardless of how you’re perceived.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetakukreja/,"I built a $400,000+ business with no website in 2 years.


(Not bragging, but it was so out of reach just 3 years ago)

The point is not 400K; the point is how?

Building a business has never been this easy, like ever.
All you need is:
-      Laptop
-      Great internet
-      Passion project

I am not gonna advise you to quit your job and start a business.
Instead, find something fun and do it with your job.

Something that you can do for 2-3 hrs a day.
For me, it was writing.

And for you, it could be anything as long as you like it.

Here’s how I got started and you can too:
1.    Make an account on Twitter (I made one on LinkedIn, a year later – I was stupid, don’t judge. and don't make this mistake.)
2.    Post regularly – whatever you are going, creating, working, or going.
3.    Be consistent and build your following to 1000+.
4.    Now make a list of all big shots on the platform.
5.    Follow them and start conversations in the comments (not DMs just now) 6.    Once you comment every day, they will remember you.
7.    Now DM them and build connections.
8.    Get them on a call with you and pitch your services.

This is what I did.
Took me 1 month at max.

And I landed my first high-ticket client.

Pro tip: Filter on the basis of revenue, location, and industry. It will save you time.

If you have any questions, shoot a comment.",Shweta Kukreja
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetakukreja/,"The bravest thing I’ve ever done is leaving my stable 9 to 5 job and starting freelancing.


Most days, things didn’t go as planned.
And I wondered if it was the right decision or not.

But when I received double the amount of payment in my bank account that I used to get in my 9-5, I thought it was not that bad after all.

But later, I started measuring my life with the happiness quotient and money.

Money is definitely a good part of the freelancing business, but the luxury to spend time as you please is definitely something I would never trade for.

Freelancing has taught me so many things, and the biggest being “how to get things done”, no matter what it is.

I was my own graphic designer, marketer, influencer, writer, editor, accountant, and manager.
It was crazy.

I am not saying it was too hard. Even though it was.
I am just saying it was worth it at the end.

Not many people say they like what they do, but I can. Even on days when I lose clients or don’t make as much as I did last month, I feel satisfied and content.

So if you are double-guessing whether or not you should quit your job and start freelancing or entrepreneurship, I’ll say take a calculated risk.
It will be risky, but it will be rational.

If you feel you should do it, just do it. Don’t second-guess.

Because one day you will look back and you’ll see how far you’ve come.

And you will be one step closer to your goals.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetakukreja/,"I have clients who pay me $20K - $50k on a retainer. So, sharing my 5-step lead gen process that I use to get quality leads:


1.    Niche
It is the very first step, no matter what you do. Pick 2-3 categories and niche down.
Ex: From marketing, I narrowed it down to personal branding.

2.    Find 2-3 clients first
Don’t run towards high-paying clients. Find small clients first.
My first client paid me INR 5000 and I used to manage all of the socials including content, engagement, and everything. But the client was famous and it gave me an added advantage to score big clients.

3.    Build your socials
Always have a good social media presence on 1 platform. I started on Twitter and now I have 95K followers there.
So start with 1 platform and keep sharing your story on that social.

4.    Create an irresistible offer
Value = Benefit – Cost
Create your offer so good that people will feel like a fool by saying No to you.
Ex: I could help you grow your revenue to $50K/m but you need to pay me $2000/m. Would you do that? Obviously YES.

5.    Cold outreach
I use LinkedIn Sales Navigator and filter out my leads. Send your potential clients a cold DM or email and give them a reason to work with you. Consistency is very important for this.

6.    Follow-ups
Make a spreadsheet and track all the people you have DMed. Keep following up. Don’t just DM, spice it up with witty one-liners.
Ex; “Hey, just bumping this up in case you missed it” Or “Hi, just following up to see if you want to make an extra $20K/m with your personal brand”. Or ""I know must be busy, but this will only benefit you""

Now, keep track of everything. Create solid SOPs to keep them in check.

Also don’t forget to add AI wherever possible.

It isnt as hard as it sounds but it isnt as easy as it looks.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shwetakukreja/,"Here's a mini guide on 5 game-changing rules that helped me grow to 150K followers: 


1.    Catchy hook
No LinkedIn post works without a catchy, emotional, or relatable hook.
The first line is what grabs the attention and makes readers read the rest.

❌ “As I was walking through the streets of London, I realized these things about money”
✅ “I went to London last week and here are a few things I realized that can save you $$$”.

2.    Use simple words
Simplicity and relatability work the best.
So don’t use complex words, keep it as simple as possible.

❌ “I didn’t anticipate this would happen when I started LinkedIn”
✅ 7 things you are not focusing on LinkedIn that can make you lose out on $2000.”

3.    Community
Yes, engagement is important but not for the sake of it.

I don’t engage much, but I do engage intentionally. I only reply or DM to the people who either engage with my posts or have some relevant things to say.

After 100s of posts, you should by now know how to cold DM. So don’t send “I am interested”, or “Any job opening”, to me or to anyone.

Instead, write why you want to work, and in which area you’re looking for a job.

4.    Write as you speak
A lot of people would disagree with it but it actually works.
It helps you get connected to your audience much faster.
Just be yourself.

Authenticity >> Fake persona

5.    Punchy CTA

Add a CTA that is relatable and makes people feel good about the post.

Here's how you can advance your services and earn MORE than $1000:

📍 Package your services well
Never send the same template to your clients.
Create 3 different packages - It will give them a chance to go through them and select one as per their budget and requirements.
It automatically increases the conversion rate.

📍 Hire people smarter than you
If you want to scale as a freelancer, you have to hire.

I have learned recently that you should hire people smarter than you - people who can take charge of the work and take loads off of you.
This will give you time to focus on the tasks that actually matter.

📍 Build your personal brand
I swear, building a personal brand has changed my life completely.
Do a job, do a side hustle, and do 100 other things, but make sure you take 10-20 mins out every day in your schedule to work on your personal brand.
because it can change your life. It certainly did mine.

📍 Networking
It doesn't necessarily mean going out to events and hanging out with your people every weekend or so, which btw is not bad at all. In fact,it’s good.

But you can also network with people through social media - send cold DMs and emails, reach out to them, have conversations, and you will eventually end up getting more work. If not, you’ll make friends at least - no downside at all.

📍 Upskill yourself
You can only be a great freelancer or an entrepreneur when you upskill yourself as well.
To deliver the best quality of work, you will have to consume and learn it too.
So invest in courses and upskill. This is very important.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanahmedva/,"Everyone says marketing is about creativity.
And honestly, it is.

But the real problem is:

•– Most marketers focus on trends, fancy visuals, and flashy campaigns… and forget the psychology that actually drives buying decisions.

And the simple solution can be:

•– Stop guessing what works. Start using human behavior to guide every move.

Think about it:

If you only follow trends, your campaigns will blend in and fade fast.

But when you use proven psychology triggers like Loss Aversion, Social Proof, or the Halo Effect suddenly, your marketing connects deeper, feels familiar, and drives action.

Your content doesn’t have to be louder.
It has to be smarter.

And when the right people feel understood, they’ll share your message for you taking it further than any ad spend could.

It’s a possibility, isn’t it?

Not to meditate.

Not to journal.

But to quietly pack my child lunch, get him dressed, and drop him off at school with a smile even when my heart wants to stay just a little longer.

Then, I step into agency mode.

Client calls.
Strategy meetings.
Team check-ins.

Deadlines.
Revisions.
Growth pressure.

All while wondering…

“Did I hug him tight enough this morning?”

“Will he miss me today?”

“Am I doing enough for him, for the business, for myself?”

Some days I feel powerful.

Other days I feel like I’m barely holding it together.

But I always show up.

With love. With grace. With a smile.

Because working moms don’t get the luxury to slow down.

We juggle nap times and pitch decks.

Tantrums and timelines.

Bedtime stories and brand stories.

So the next time you see a woman showing up in meetings, on Zoom, in pitches

Know that behind that polished face might be a tired heart doing her best.

They’re holding you back.. 

I see so many LinkedIn myths every week. Some are holding people back from real results.

Let’s break them down (and save you some time):

1. External links hurt your post’s reach?
❌ FALSE

You can add links in your post now. (Links in comments might get seen less, though.)

2. A huge following is necessary for leads?
❌ FALSE

I got the same number of leads with 7,000 followers as I do with 41,000. It’s about your engagement, not your follower count.

3. Editing your post reduces reach?
✔️ KIND OF TRUE

If you edit in the first 24 hours, yes, your reach can drop. I fix mistakes in the comments if I need to.

4. LinkedIn Premium is needed for visibility?
❌ FALSE

Premium won’t boost your content. Focus on writing strong posts people care about.

5. Only selfies get engagement?
✔️ - ❌ TRUE + FALSE

Selfies can do well, but slides and infographics work too. Posts with attachments get 6x more engagement.

6. LinkedIn will block you for checking profiles too often?
❌ FALSE

You won’t get blocked, but if you never engage, it looks strange.

7. Most people don’t post on LinkedIn?
✔️ TRUE

Less than 5% post often, but engagement is growing fast. That means big chances for you.

8. There’s a limit to how many connection requests you can send?
✔️ TRUE

There’s a daily limit. I find new connections in comments, profile viewers, and even competitor lists.

I stopped following these myths.

Instead, I focus on what works:
→ Share value.
→ Engage with others.
→ Use the data, not the rumors.

💬 Are any of these myths stopping you from sharing more on LinkedIn?",Saman Ahmed

What you do need:

✅ Positioning that signals value
✅ CTAs that move people forward
✅ A clear path from post to pipeline

Ask yourself:
→ Are the right people reaching out because of what I post?
→ Do I know which content leads to calls, or am I just guessing?
→ Is there a path from post to deal, or does it stop at likes?

→ Every day, great content goes unseen.

Step 1: Think Hook First:
↳ You have 3 seconds to grab attention.
↳ If your first line fails, the post is dead.
↳ Write a strong hook to stop the scroll.

Step 2: Write Below the 5th Grade Level:
↳ Simple words mean more engagement.
↳ If they don’t get it, they won’t engage.
↳ Speak like to your friend, not a professor.

Step 3: Use Proven Frameworks:
↳ Struggling to structure your posts?
↳ Frameworks turn ideas into results.
↳ Use PAS, AIDA, SLAY & many others.

Step 4: End with a Power Ending:
↳ Your post is great. Don’t fade out! End strong.
↳ Your last words decide what happens next ↓
↳ Leave them with a thought, action, or challenge.

↳ More reach
↳ More conversions

It’s not just the late nights disappearing, it’s the spark. The curiosity. The energy to do things.

Most free time now isn’t being lived.
It’s being scrolled away on phones.
A constant digital escape that quietly makes the real world feel optional.

Parents spent decades trying to keep kids out of clubs.

The smartphone did it in 5 years and rewired social habits while it was at it.

When your life mostly happens online, the offline world becomes just the “in-between” moments. But that’s where creativity, ambition, and connection actually grow.

The real concern isn’t what Gen Z stopped doing.

It’s what they’ve stopped wanting to do.",Dhriti Jain
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/-dhritijain/,"Fun fact: Priority used to be a singular word.

It meant “the very first thing.” The most important task.

Then, somewhere along the way, we made it plural to priorities. And just like that, the meaning diluted.

Because when everything is urgent, nothing truly is.

I’ve seen this at work and in life:
-Trying to tackle 5 top priorities in one day.
-Saying yes to every meeting, every request.
-Ending the week exhausted, but unsure what actually moved forward.

Now, I ask myself:
If I could only get ONE thing done today, what would it be?
That becomes the priority. Everything else is noise until it’s done.

It’s simple. But this shift has made me sharper, calmer, and surprisingly more productive.

Because focus isn’t about doing more.
It’s about doing the most important thing first.",Dhriti Jain
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/-dhritijain/,"I’ve realised something over the last few years —

One of the best things I can do for the people I love is take care of my own energy.

When I’m well-rested & centred, I show up better.
I listen without snapping. I laugh more. I’m more patient, more present.

But when I’m drained or overwhelmed, even small things feel heavy. And the people closest to me feel the ripple effects.

So I’ve started being more intentional:
About rest. About boundaries. About doing things that refill me.

Because staying kind, optimistic, and high-energy isn’t just a personality trait.
It’s a daily choice, a practice that takes effort.

It comes from saying yes to things outside your daily deliverables.

From delivering on governance packs to attending events like this hackathon, I’ve always believed in engaging beyond my core role.

This wasn’t about coding or winning.
It was about collaboration, creativity, and building that visibility muscle we often underestimate.

Because here’s what I’ve seen:

-You meet people outside your daily circle.
-You get noticed for your energy, not just your output.
-You build confidence in rooms that don’t know your title, just your ideas.

3/ Learned: Following up isn’t pushy, it’s professional.
Staying in touch doesn’t mean being transactional.

4/ Unlearned: Networking only happens at events or conferences.

Here’s a roadmap to simplify your personal brand-

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-panova/,"The #1 reason people stay stuck on LinkedIn? 
They follow advice that’s not for them.

From day one, advice came from all sides:

→ “Don’t sell”
→ “Post every day”
→ “Stick to one niche”
→ “Just provide value”
→ “Write like a storyteller”
→ “Add a CTA on every post”
→ “Only post in the morning”
→ “Use 3 hashtags, not 5”
→ “Carousels are dead”
→ “Don’t share links”

It wasn’t bad advice.
It just wasn’t mine.

So I stopped following the rules.

And made my own:
→ I tested different hooks & tones
→ I tried new engagement strategies
→ I explored content inspo ()
→ I tracked what actually moved the needle

No one gave me a formula.
I built one through action.

I didn’t grow by doing everything.
I grew by doing what actually fit me.

LinkedIn growth doesn’t come from copying.
It comes from clarity, consistency, and guts.

P.S. Which “rule” do you wish you ignored?",Marina Panova
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marina-panova/,"Everyone thinks LinkedIn growth = posting more. 
But more content doesn’t build real growth.

The truth no one likes?

Posting is easy.
Managing relationships is the hard part.

And that’s why most people lose:
→ DMs pile up.
→ Comments never get followed up.
→ Connections get accepted, then forgotten.

Opportunities slip through the cracks.
Revenue slips with them.

Visibility without organisation = wasted growth.

LinkedIn doesn’t reward who posts the most.
It rewards who manages attention the best.

So stop chasing volume.
Start building systems.

Here’s the exact system I run:

1️⃣ Track every single conversation
2️⃣ Set reminders for every follow-up
3️⃣ Segment your network with purpose
4️⃣ Audit weekly. Cut noise. Double down

That’s how connections turn into clients.

I sold before I felt ready.
I raised my prices before I felt “worthy.”

→ My first high-paying clients
→ A booked-out service
→ Moved to Spain

I built a business I was proud of.

→ 100+ freelancers coached
→ 150+ businesses helped

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bushranasrullah/,"Most people ignore how LinkedIn search actually works, then wonder why nobody can find them.

Fixing profiles day in and day out taught me this:

1) LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes RELEVANCE over popularity.

- Your profile must match what people are searching for
- Generic keywords = generic ranking

2) Your headline is search gold.

- LinkedIn weights headline terms 3x more than other sections

- Yet most people waste it on ""Founder | CEO | Coffee Lover""

(Those aren't search terms!)

3) You're keyword stuffing (and it's backfiring).

- LinkedIn penalizes obvious stuffing
- Natural integration > forced repetition

4) You're ignoring the ""Skills"" section.

- Each endorsed skill is a direct search signal
- Arrange them strategically (top 3 matter most)

5) Your content doesn't reinforce your keywords.

- Posts/comments strengthen your search relevance
- Inconsistent messaging confuses the algorithm

6) You're not leveraging your Experience section.

- Each role description = prime keyword real estate
- Most people just list responsibilities

7) You haven't completed your profile.

- LinkedIn rewards completeness
- Every empty field reduces your search potential

You just need to approach LinkedIn search like a STRATEGIST, not someone hoping to get lucky in search results.

And once you master that?

Your profile won't just get occasional views.
It'll become a client-generating machine that works 24/7.

LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes relevance over follower count.

Fix: Focus on being found by the right people, not everyone.

And never ignore your Skills section ... it's search gold! 😉

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bushranasrullah/,"If you want to revive a ""dead"" LinkedIn account in 7 days without posting daily, gather here:

I once had only 1,000 impressions and got zero traction or leads... until I realized I was doing LinkedIn all wrong.

Meanwhile, my clients were jumping to 100,000+ impressions using my exact system.

Here's exactly how I'd revive it in 7 days:

1. Engage before you post

Leave 70-80 comments daily for 6 days a week.
This primes the algorithm to recognize you as valuable.
Your future posts will get pushed to more feeds as a result.

2. Post with strategic intention

3-5 posts weekly (different formats) beats daily posting.
One story, one value post, one authority-builder.
Quality always trumps quantity on LinkedIn.

3. Own your comments section completely.

Own your comments section (active for 45+ mins)
Reply to EVERY comment (make them conversations).
Add 2-3 bonus comments with extra insights.

4. Build connections with purpose

10-15 targeted connection requests/DMs daily.
Not selling - just connecting authentically.
Mix peers, prospects, and re-engaging old connections.

5. Create a sustainable rhythm.

Consistency matters more than intensity.
Some can post daily, others can't. That's fine.
The goal is sustainability, not burnout.

Give yourself 30-60 days if you're starting fresh.

Literally, just follow this system → watch your impressions grow → see 1,000 become 100,000+ in weeks.

I do this every... single... day. 😊

Pro tip: The algorithm needs to be ""primed"" before your posts will perform well.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bushranasrullah/,"Why your headline isn't selling you on LinkedIn 

Your LinkedIn headline is your digital first impression. But most people get it completely wrong.

1) They focus on job titles instead of outcomes.
2) They list skills instead of solutions.

3) They speak about themselves instead of their audience.

Your headline should answer ONE question:

""What problem do I solve for others?""

This is why your current headline isn't selling you:

It's too vague (""Marketing Professional"")
It's all about you, not your audience
It lacks specificity on WHO you help

It doesn't highlight the transformation you provide
It blends in with thousands of others

Turn ""Marketing Manager"" into ""I help LinkedIn creators monetize their audience through my Connection-to-Cash System""

See the difference?

One is a title. The other is a promise.

Bonus:

The 'Problem-Solution Method':

Each headline I write has:

The audience → makes it targeted
The problem → shows understanding
The solution → demonstrates value

Your headline should make people WANT to click your profile.

Because they see the value you offer immediately.

- Start selling your unique value proposition instead.

I've been shouting this from the rooftops:

You're practically invisible.

I discovered Donald Miller's StoryBrand framework and realized:

I had been making myself the hero of my brand's story.
But that role belongs to the customer.

The truth is:

Your customers don't care about your journey
They don't care about your values
They don't care about your ""why""

They care about ONE thing:
""Can you help me get what I want?""

(But one thing hasn’t changed.)

People still think big numbers mean big results.

Last week, I was reviewing posts in a ghostwriting group.

“I optimized 50 profiles this week.”
“I worked with 500+ founders.”
“I made $10K in 3 days.”

No screenshots → No breakdowns → Just bold claims.

And here’s the problem:

Clients are smarter now.
Audiences are tired of fluff.
Even LinkedIn's algorithm favors transparency.

That’s why I stopped chasing likes and started sharing receipts.

Here’s what I post instead:

1 real client win.
Before & after metrics.
A breakdown of what worked (and what didn’t).

Because I’ve learned something important:

People don’t believe words → they believe evidence.
Numbers without context = noise.
Real results build real trust.

As a ghostwriter, my mission is clear:

Share honest progress, not polished perfection.
Show how the post performed, not just that it “worked.”
Help others write with integrity, not just intensity.

Because content without credibility… doesn’t convert.

And in 2025, your brand isn’t built on claims →It’s built on proof.

Repost ♻️ if you’re done with fluff posts and fake stats.

P.S. Do you trust big claims without proof?",Bushra N.
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bushranasrullah/,"Back in December 2024, I signed a new client.

She was one of my highest-paying clients.

But more than that, she was kind, soft-spoken, and deeply genuine.

She didn’t just need content.

Sometimes, she just needed someone to talk to.

She would message me;
“Bushra, I’m not okay today. Can we talk?”

And WE did → We talked about work → About life. ↓

About the things she didn’t feel safe sharing with anyone else.

We stopped being just client and writer.

We became friends.

A few days ago, I texted her.
No reply. I called. No answer.

Then I reached out to her daughter on IG.

And that’s when I heard the words I wasn’t prepared for.

She’s NO more.

Since yesterday, I’ve had a severe migraine.
I’ve taken 4–5 tablets.

But nothing seems to help, not the pain in my head or the heaviness in my heart.

Today, I didn’t feel like working. Or posting.
Or pretending to be okay.

The lesson: Freelancing isn’t always about money or growth.

Sometimes, it gives you real human connections.

And when you lose them, it truly hurts.

(And most LinkedIn creators have empty stores)

The hard truth about hooks that nobody wants to admit:

People decide to read your post in 2-3 seconds
(That's literally the time it takes to scroll past)

Your brilliant insights mean nothing with a weak hook
(It's like having amazing products in a store nobody enters)

Clarity beats creativity every single time
(Nobody stops for ""clever"" - they stop for value)

Problem-focused hooks outperform solution-focused hooks
(Pain is a stronger motivator than pleasure)

Your first line should feel like it's speaking directly to ONE person
(The ""that's literally me"" effect is powerful)

When your hook works, everything else works.
When your hook fails, nothing else matters.

Stop focusing only on posting → Build these 4 systems instead!

You can easily create consistent content by:

-Building the RIGHT profile
-Creating topic CLUSTERS
-Mining platforms for IDEAS
-Making 30 pieces from 1 CONCEPT

Before you say it, NO. This doesn't mean creating MORE content. It means creating SMARTER content.

Take a look at these examples:

""I need to post every day to succeed""
↳ Nothing wrong with consistency. But without systems, you'll burn out fast, and results will suffer!

""I need strategic systems that make posting easier""
↳ This approach is sustainable. Plus, it's repeatable. Plus, people actually enjoy the process!

So... want better LinkedIn results?

Make your strategy ""easily sustainable.""

My proven ways to make LinkedIn sustainable (repeatedly):

Client-focused profile → speaks to problems
Organized topic clusters → prevents idea drought
Strategic content mining → turns questions into posts
Content multiplication → works smarter, not harder

Why? Because none of these depend on ""posting daily"".

Turn ""systems"" into ""consistency"" → That's the goal!

The rest are waking up to the fact that, in an oversaturated space, you can’t just depend on the algorithm.

Case in point: the flood of brands turning their logos orange for Taylor Swift’s new album.

It’s time for brands to reclaim ownership of their worlds instead of merely renting space on the algorithm.

I was struggling to put the right words behind this phenomena until I stumbled upon “The Etymology Nerd” by Adam Aleksic.

In his most recent article, he explores how our forms of communication have evolved from ritual to transmission. In the ritual view, communication is about shared identity and community, rooted in oral tradition and fellowship. With technology, this shifted toward a transmission view, where the focus became the efficient delivery of information rather than connection.

There’s something really powerful about reclaiming that ritual. The first brand to truly do it well will set a new standard. Because when you sacrifice connection for the rush, people inevitably start craving the very thing they’ve lost.

I had the joy and honor of sharing the stage with Jake Shane,, and—my fellow Muslim, Pakistani girlboss! We had an unfiltered, vulnerable convo about how to become the internet’s fave and literally danced on stage. The lore of how I bestie'd Zaria? My friend texted me that he met her at a brown wedding and I immediately told him to befriend her because I am *obsessed with her.* Now, we reunited in the south of France. That is the fan to friend pipeline in action.

While creators truly ruled Cannes this year, a special shoutout goes to the global stars I’ve followed and admired from afar and finally got to meet IRL.
British baddies like Ayamé, Nella Rose, and Niko Omilana flew in from across the border, and it was so heartwarming to introduce them to the brand world that gathers in Cannes. If you know me, you know my YouTube algorithm is deep in Sidemen, Beta Squad, and AMP content. I may not be the “expected” viewer, but I watch, like, and comment on their 3 hour long videos like it’s my job. Can confirm, they danced their hearts out atbeach! (Shoutout of,,xx)

Big love to,, my British whisperers because they connected me to,to fulfill my YouTube dreams. It was magical to bring these global creators into real-time convos with CMOs who care about their audiences.

👋 It’s unlikely Instagram will introduce the ability to create longer Reels, as Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, claims in an Ask Me Anything that: “ short videos are more aligned with what we’re trying to achieve.”

🤭 China is adamant that it won’t sell its TikTok algorithm to the US, meaning the possibility of the app going dark by the September 17th deadline is very real. Unless Donald Trump extends the deadline, again.

📌 LinkedIn FINALLY brings back the ability to pin comments. Which would be incredible if it was true, but this is the fake update for the folks who steal Annie-Mai's content.

📈 Instagram adds a new interactive chart in insights that shows retention metrics for Reels, along with skip rate.

👀 LinkedIn looks to tackle fake engagement on the platform by limiting how many comments a member or a LinkedIn page can make in a certain time period. And if the platform detects excessive comment creation, or use of an automated tool, it’ll decrease the visibility of those comments.

✍️ YouTube provides tips on how to come up with content ideas, including: reinventing your greatest hits, tapping into trends, and using search data.

📲 Adam Mosseri, Head of Instagram, confirms that there’s no perfect amount of time to wait before posting another piece of content on the platform, and that it just depends on your audience.

Through stimulating essays and engaging stories, the book highlights how and why these ideas have flourished for over 150 years now, and what lessons we can take away into our own companies and careers.

The Hindi translation has been carried out by eminent Hindi journalist and author,. It has taken Dr. Mishra more than 400 hours of work to complete this translation. And I know this has been a labour of love for him.

Why were my co-author and I keen on this Hindi translation? Because less than 10% of India reads in English. Whereas around 45% of India reads in Hindi. And the simple, powerful ideas of this book deserve to be known across our country.

We are also working on translations into other Indian languages. It takes time to ensure that the essence of the book is captured in every language. But we are determined to deliver as many translations as possible.

Last week, I had the privilege of being part of the jury for the Hindu Business Line Changemaker awards, at Chennai.

Our jury was chaired by Duvvuri Subbarao, renowned economist and former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India. He is widely credited with steering the Indian economy through the 2008 financial crisis.

At these jury deliberations, however, the lesson I learnt from him was not from the realm of economics. It was about how to effectively chair a meeting.

He provided us a masterclass on this subject.

First, he clearly defined the objective of the discussion at hand.

Second, he requested every member of the jury to state their views, listening intently all the time.

Third, only after having listened to all of us on the jury, did he state his own views.

Fourth, if there was no emerging consensus, he defined the issues that were on the table, posed a couple of key questions around these issues, and encouraged us to respond. This helped clarify and share our thinking.

Finally, he took the considered opinion of all jury members, and enabled us to reach a conclusion, either by consensus or by majority.

In-between these steps, he also encouraged (or perhaps tolerated) the occasional storytelling and humour from some of us, that keeps such serious meetings light and peppy.

And, to top it all, he ensured that we concluded the jury deliberations well in time !

I came away with many learnings - from his disciplined approach, patience, sharp listening skills and his ability to synthesise the issues and thoughts coming up from across the table. Thank you, Mr. Subbarao !

Sometimes, when you watch a master in action, your learnings are far more powerful than from any textbook or classroom. Do you agree?

There are some meals that I simply lust for. One of them is parotta with Chettinad style egg curry (Muttai curry, in Tamil).

So, when I was in Chennai two days ago, I was sort of dreaming of this dinner throughout the day. Pictures of eggs kept appearing in my mind, from time to time.

When my dinner did arrive, it was simply delicious. The egg curry was made with a spicy tomato-onion gravy, flavoured with coconut and dry chilly. The chef had also added a few small onions (shallots), which was a surprise, and gave it a lovely mouthfeel.

The parotta was made in typical Madras style, with a crispy, flaky texture. I asked for one, but the chef gave me two. Because he said that two eggs deserved two parottas. How can you argue with that logic?

Parotta & egg curry is a culinary match made in heaven. Just like idlis & coconut chutney, or appam & stew, or kulcha & chole. Here is a combination that teases your senses, delivers a melange of beautiful flavours and then lulls you into a state of happy satisfaction. That is what any great meal should do.

For all of us who travel often on work, seeking out and eating the best of local food gives us such a well-deserved break between all the long meetings, waiting at airports, lugging bags and wondering about the impact of AI. I believe that we, the nomads of this modern corporate era, owe these small treats to ourselves. Do you agree?

#BhatThink (But Think)

17. Be Kind

This week, take a few minutes to be kind to someone.

Be kind to someone who is struggling with a project, or who is going through a tough professional or personal patch. Take a few minutes to listen to them.

Call a team member who needs an emotional lift-up, and tell them how proud you are of the work they have done recently.

Or reach out to a colleague who is recovering from an illness and speak to them about their day.

Kindness is not just a good act towards others. It also helps us, because when we engage in an act of kindness, we become happier. And when we are happier, we are more creative, and more productive.

This is what I have learnt during my working life, over the past four decades. Let me know what you think.

My grandmother, parents, sister and I would then eat these lovely cakes with great relish, licking the sweet butter that was layered within them.

After I grew up and began working, I have eaten many splendid cakes, from famous bakeries - La Patisserie of the Taj, or Theobroma in Mumbai and Bangalore. I have not kept count, but I must have eaten atleast 200 different varieties of rich cakes during my life.

But always, in my mind, the Japanese cake has remained the most special treat. Because it was the cake that my Mother rewarded us with on special days.

So, recently, when I was visiting Coimbatore, I found the Japanese cakes once again in that very same bakery. All those beautiful memories of childhood came right back into my mind.

I wished my Mother were here by my side, to buy me these cakes once again - but she was at home in Bangalore. I wished my grandmother was still alive, to eat them along with me. I wished I were a carefree school boy once again, having completed the last day of my exams.

I stared at these cakes for a long time, quite wistfully. More than once, I nearly asked the bakery guy to pack a few for me. But finally, I walked out of that bakery without buying them.

Because these cakes were my Mother's special treat for me, a symbol of her love and affection for her child. How could I buy them for myself?",Harish Bhat

43. Re-skilling lessons

In a remarkable turn of events, our neighbourhood tailor in Bangalore has very recently begun a new line of business - making and selling South Indian snacks such as butter murukku and lace pakodas.

This bespoke tailor has been stitching garments for my wife for over 20 years. But now, her snacks are delicious. We have been eating them for the past few days as if we have never eaten murukkus ever before.

There are different interpretations of this unexpected move by our tailor.

I pointed out (mainly so that I look clever to my wife) that this diversification is a clear example that lots of re-skilling can still happen without any AI. Natural hunger beats artificial intelligence, any day.

I also highlighted (using my MBA analytical skills) that perhaps there is deeper business strategy at work here. Maybe eating all these fried snacks will soon lead to our requiring many more new tailored clothes.

My wife pointed out that if a tailor can learn how to make snacks, then a semi-retired marketer can learn how to use the washing machine at home.

I like to be direct in these matters, so I asked her whether she was referring to me. She said that the guilty always know.

I resumed eating the snacks made by our tailor, and offered some to my wife as well.

But I know that my task for the weekend has been well defined. It is quite remarkable how any thread of conversation with my wife generally ends up in the same place - which is, a new task for me.

Yesterday, I informed my wife Dr. Veena H Bhatthat I would be speaking at a fireside chat organized by Adobe later this week.

My wife said – “Adobe? What will you do there? They are a digital experience company, but you are not even a technology guy.”

I told her – “I will be doing a fireside chat covering three topics - building strong brands, impactful storytelling, and leadership. Every Company appreciates these skills.”

My wife responded – “All these skills are fine, Harish. But can we please do a fireside chat ourselves first? I also want to discuss three things with you – ensuring that you get all our clothes ironed by the ironing shop every week, making sure that you get your Mother’s medications well in time each month, and buying ripe bananas for tomorrow.”

My 89-year old Mother was hospitalised for four days. She received excellent treatment, was discharged yesterday and is now back home to her own room and bed.

Sitting in her room at a small hospital in Bangalore, I reflected on the following points.

1. I am grateful that I have the ability to access good private healthcare in India. This has happened because my parents invested in providing me excellent education - which in turn gave me a good job and career at the Tata group, and enabled me to build some financial security for my family. Good education gives us the wings to fly, and enables us to build our nests for the future.

2. The Doctors and nursing staff at this hospital were extraordinary. They were so dedicated, responsive and caring. They treated my Mother like their own. There was a sense of ownership and responsibility which is rare to see in these modern times. The diagnosis was thoughtful, and the treatment was sharply tailored. To all of them, and to all medical professionals, I am grateful for the efforts they invest in patient care. Good Doctors and nursing staff are the lifeline of our world. We don't appreciate them enough.

3. When a medical emergency happens, it takes over everything else in our lives. For my wife and me, the rest of our world came to a pause for four days, while we ran between home and hospital and home. Health of our family members, and our own health, determines so much of the trajectories of our lives. Health is the most important investment we can ever make.

It was lovely to see the smile on my Mother's face when she returned home. All my other reflections stopped at that point. When our parents are healthy and happy, that means the world to us.

I would like to dedicate this post to all the Doctors and Nurses who spend their entire professional lives ensuring the good health of everyone who comes into their care. We owe so much to you. Thank you.",Harish Bhat

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/peaceitimi/,"Over the past two months, I’ve had the privilege of visiting both North and South America as part of my MBA exchange programme at Imperial Business School. First Houston, then São Paulo; two very different cities, but each offered sharp lessons in business, culture, and technology.

I chose themodule on Sales Leadership and Management quite intentionally. My current work involves everything from B2C acquisition to B2B partnerships and strategic storytelling—so spending time with seasoned professors in the American sales tradition felt timely. We also visited a company that’s operated in Houston for over two decades, which brought a practical layer to the classroom discussions. It was a valuable window into how American businesses structure and sustain long-term growth.

São Paulo, by contrast, was all about digital transformation and artificial intelligence in emerging markets. I didn’t expect to come away so deeply interested in Brazil—but learning about its scale, its consumer behaviour, and its appetite for innovation shifted my perspective. From agri-tech to fintech to nightlife, AI is being applied in fascinating ways. Conversations with IBM Brazil,,and other local players helped me see both the opportunities and the challenges ahead for LATAM markets.

As I approach the last two weeks of my MBA classes 🤓, I’m reflecting on how grateful I am to have had these kinds of global learning experiences. Not just in theory, but on the ground—with people, with companies, and in context.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/peaceitimi/,"I was at the Builder's Summit by Founder's Connect today and while there were a lot of great conversations, one fireside chat really stuck with me.

It was anchored byof Reneé PR and featuredof Big Cabal Media. The topic was The Media Advantage: How Perception Shapes Growth for both Founders and Talents.

For me, it wasn’t your typical event talk, it was a reminder that how we tell our stories matters, and it often starts closer to home than we think.

A few things he said wouldn't be leaving me in a hurry. One was you don’t need to be in big publications to be visible. Start where you are. At work, in your communities, in your group chats. That’s where real visibility begins. Word of mouth still matters. Don’t be shy about what you’re working on. Talk to everyone who cares to listen. One added advantage is that your idea actually gets sharper the more you speak about it.

Peer-to-peer networks are also underrated. We spend so much time chasing “top people” when the real growth often comes from building with those on our level. And then there’s storytelling. I can't stress its importance enough. Tomiwa is big on design because design helps bring a story to life. Whether it’s your pitch deck, your website, or even a tweet, how you present what you're building makes a difference.

He also shared some truths about getting media attention.

First, lead with substance. A lot of people get caught up in chasing visibility too early. But if what you’re building isn’t grounded in something real, the spotlight won’t do much for you.

Second, keep people in the loop. Don’t wait until you’ve hit a major milestone to talk about what you’re doing. Share your process. Let people see the journey.

And then, build relationships with the media the same way you would with collaborators or friends. If you meet a journalist who covers your space, don’t just reach out when you need a story. Stay in touch. Check in. Share what you’re working on from time to time.

That felt like success.

I remember telling my dad about the plan, expecting him to be excited. He was. But then he said something I’ll never forget:

“Make sure you prepare for success.”

At the time, I didn’t get it. We were just hoping it would work. But he was right.
Most of us never think about what comes after the breakthrough. We focus so much on surviving that we forget to ask: What happens when things take off?

If your idea works...
+ Are you ready to hire and lead people?
+ Can your systems handle growth?
+ Do your values scale with your business?
+ Have you thought about how you want to grow with it?

More responsibility. More complexity. More people depending on you. It’s exciting and it’s heavy.

That one line from my dad changed how we thought aboutmade us slower to chase shiny things and faster to build foundations we could stand on.

Not hypothetically.
Actually.

In just 22 days it handled:
1,600+ conversations
304 demo requests
98 SOC 2 requests
16 pricing conversations

Convincing creates pressure.

The subtext is: I don’t trust you’ll come back, so I need to secure control right now.

Humans sense that agenda immediately.

They can smell you commission breath.

Pressure activates resistance.

Understanding sounds like this:
Early in the call:
“So I don’t do you a disservice by sending irrelevant info, would it be okay if I asked a couple questions?”

Later in the call:
“Sure. What’s your email? What type of info would you like?”

It sparks curiosity (they think, not resist).

It preserves autonomy (the insight feels like theirs).

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"A champion leaves. A competitor undercuts your price. Legal delays the contract.

Most reps treat these as surprises. But the gangster reps already saw them coming.

If you don't do this already, you should consider running ""what-if"" scenarios like you're a chess master.


Here's how to approach it:


1. What if your champion leaves?


Before it happens:

- Map the full buying committee and build relationships across functions.
- Ask your champion: ""If you weren't here tomorrow, who would drive this decision forward?""
- Document their specific language and priorities so you can replicate their influence.


When it does happen:

- Leverage the departed champion's credibility: ""Sarah specifically mentioned this would solve your Q4 capacity issues.""
- Pivot to the technical buyer: ""Sarah felt strongly that your engineering team needed to own the integration timeline.""
- Use internal references: ""Sarah connected me with your VP of Operations because she knew he'd appreciate the automation benefits.""



2. What if a competitor slashes pricing?


Never compete on cost alone:

- Pre-build ROI models showing 18-month payback vs. competitors' 36-month timeline.
- Emphasize switching costs: ""Moving from your current system will require 6 weeks of developer time. Our API integration takes 3 days.""
- Document proof points competitors can't match: ""We're the only solution that integrates natively with Salesforce AND HubSpot.""


Build your ""Why We Win"" document with:

- Specific customer success stories in their vertical.
- Technical capabilities that require no workarounds.
- Implementation timelines that beat industry standards.
- Support SLAs that competitors don't offer.



3. What if a deal stalls in legal?


Get ahead of contract negotiations:

- Ask upfront: ""What contract terms typically slow down your legal reviews?""
- Bring your own legal counsel to prospect meetings: ""Our legal team can address any redlines in real-time.""
- Provide template MSAs: ""Here's our standard agreement. Your legal team can review this while we finalize technical requirements.""


Anticipate common sticking points:

- Data processing agreements for compliance-sensitive industries.
- Liability caps that match the customer's risk tolerance.
- Termination clauses that protect both parties.
- Service level guarantees that legal teams actually approve.



4. What if the budget gets cut?


Build multiple buying scenarios:

- Phase 1 implementation that shows immediate ROI.
- Pilot programs that prove value before full rollout.
- Consumption-based pricing that scales with usage.
- Multi-year agreements with lower annual commitments.


Prepare budget defense talking points:

- ""This pays for itself in 8 months through automation savings.""
- ""Delaying costs you $50K per month in manual processes.""
- ""The pilot requires zero upfront investment.""

6 months later, average deal size has dropped 40% and customer churn is through the roof. 🕺


Folks, sales velocity ain't about speed as much as its about removing friction from the buying process.

Speed-obsessed teams end up creating ARTIFICIAL (read: bullshit) urgency:

- Discount deadlines that train customers to wait for sales.
- Pressure tactics that make buyers uncomfortable.
- Rushed discovery that misses critical requirements.
- Demo-heavy processes that skip proper qualification.

The result is often faster cycles filled with smaller, lower-quality deals that churn faster than you can replace them.


It might make sense to kinda flip this on its head and focus on doing the opposite:

- Slow down discovery to understand the real problem.
- Involve more stakeholders early to prevent surprises later.
- Build business cases that justify larger investments.
- Design onboarding that ensures customer success.


In general, SMB deals average 60-90 days while ENT deals take 6+ months, but ENT deals are typically 5-50x larger in value.

Also, per some fancy research from SBI, a sales approach that focused on ""pushing"" prospects through faster cycles actually increased sales cycle times, while approaches that ""pulled"" buyer context shortened cycles.


This obsession with velocity creates a bunch of problems.

First, you start measuring activity instead of outcomes. Reps optimize for moving deals through stages instead of moving customers toward decisions.

Second, you sacrifice deal quality for cycle speed. The fastest deals are often the worst deals.


So, what should you optimize for instead?

Friction reduction:

- How many unnecessary steps can you remove?
- Where do deals stall most often, and why?
- What information do buyers need to make confident decisions?
- Which stakeholders need to be involved from the beginning?


Here are the metrics you'd wanna look at:

- ACV trends.
- Customer satisfaction at 90 days.
- Expansion revenue rates by cohort.
- Churn rates by sales cycle length.


The companies with the best ""velocity"" often have the longest sales cycles in their category.

They build relationships that lead to bigger deals. They involve stakeholders who prevent implementation failures. They create urgency around business outcomes, not arbitrary deadlines.

Some deals SHOULD take 6 months. Trying to compress a 6-month decision into 60 days is asking for trouble.


Remember: a 180-day cycle that closes a $500K deal with 95% retention is infinitely better than a 60-day cycle that closes a $150K deal with 60% churn, right?

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Your biggest competitor isn't listed on G2. Why? Well, because it's usually the objection you never heard.

Even with that said, most reps avoid conflict like the plague. They smooth over disagreements, sidestep tough questions, and pray the buying committee magically finds consensus while they're crafting follow-up emails.


Meanwhile, the real dealbreakers are festering in Slack channels and hallway conversations you'll never access.


Asstressed during’s session last week on Multithreading, your job isn't preventing disagreement. It's dragging it into daylight before it assassinates your deal in the dark.


Think about it...that objection exists whether you surface it or not. Better to fight it when you're in the room than watch it kill your forecast when you're not.


Here are some uncomfortable questions you definitely should start asking:

- ""Who's most likely to push back on this approach?""
- ""What concerns do you have about moving forward?""
- ""If someone wanted to poke holes in this plan, what would they target?""
- ""When your leadership debates this issue, what does that sound like?""


This stuff is critical since objections don't disappear when you ignore them. They multiply like bacteria in a petri dish. The person most likely to torpedo your deal is the one you're not talking to.

And buyers actually respect sellers who acknowledge the elephant stomping around the boardroom.


Wanna know the gangster question that's saved more deals than every discount combined? It's this:

""Is there anyone on your team you're worried about when it comes to getting this approved?""

Because here's what happens when you don't ask:

- Week 8: ""Everything looks great, we're just waiting on final approvals.""
- Week 12: ""There are some concerns from IT about security protocols.""
- Week 16: ""We've decided to table this until next quarter.""

The IT concern existed in Week 1. You just never excavated it.


Disagreement is intelligence, not resistance. The person pushing back is showing you exactly what needs proving.

Conflict means engagement. Silent buyers are the dangerous ones who smile through demos then ghost you for three weeks.

Early objections beat late surprises every single time.",Matt Green
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Everyone sends the same post-meeting email. Bullet points. Action items. ""Thanks for your time."" Delete. Here's one idea that came out of a recent AE Peer Group here at:

Turn your notes into a 30-second video summary instead.

AI-generated slideshow with voiceover that hits the key points visually. Your champion can forward a video to their boss easier than a wall of bullet points.


Here's the walkthrough

1. Export your meeting notes fromor whatever you use.


2. Feed the transcript into an AI video tool.

Add this prompt: ""Create a 30-second slideshow summarizing our discovery call with [company]. Include 3-4 key slides covering their main challenges, our proposed solution, and next steps.""


3. Add their company logo to slides. Reference specific stakeholders by name.

Include one data point that matters to their business: ""This could save you $200K annually based on your team size.""


4. Track who actually watches. Most AI video tools show engagement data. You'll know exactly who watched what percentage.

Try getting that insight from your text email.


5. Follow up based on viewing behavior. Watched 85%? They're engaged. Schedule the next call immediately.

Watched 20%? Wrong message or wrong audience. Dig deeper on needs.

Didn't watch? They want text, not video. Adjust your approach.


IMO here's when it makes sense to invest the 5-10 mins to do this:

- ENT deals worth $50K+.
- Multi-stakeholder discovery calls.
- When you need internal selling to happen.
- Deals where your champion needs to brief their boss.


When to skip it:

- Routine check-ins.
- Low-value transactions.
- Contacts who clearly prefer text communication.


Here are some AI video tools to try: Synthesia, Loom AI, or Pictory.


Meeting notes are commoditized. Everyone sends them. Few read them.

Video summaries force attention and create advocates.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Your hiring plan was built in Q4. Your job descriptions were copied from 2023. Your interview process tests for skills that worked when budgets were easy.

Meanwhile, your buyers have fundamentally changed how they evaluate, approve, and implement new solutions.

Guess who's going to miss their number?


Most sales hiring is ass backwards. You hire for the market you just figured out, not the market you're ABOUT to face.

The result is that there's a yuge lag problem, and your hiring insights are stale before the first interview.

By the time you identify what ""good"" looks like, translate it into job requirements, source candidates, and complete interviews, the market has shifted.

Which means that you're solving yesterday's problems with tomorrow's hires.


Consider stuff that changed while you were hiring:

1. Buyer committee expansion.

- Last year: 3-4 decision makers.
- This year: 6-8 stakeholders involved in every deal.

Are your reps still pitching to champions instead of orchestrating committee consensus?


2. Budget scrutiny intensification.

- Last year: ROI models were nice-to-have.
- This year: CFO approval is standard for $25K+ deals.

Are they still leading with features instead of financial impact?


3. Implementation risk paranoia.

- Last year: ""Will this work?""
- This year: ""What if this fails?""

They still selling transformation instead of de-risking change?


4. Competitive displacement acceleration.

- Last year: Buyers compared 2-3 options.
- This year: Buyers evaluate 5+ alternatives including ""do nothing.""

Is your team still assuming they're in two-horse races?


This all culminates in the skill gaps folks didn't see coming.

Your current team might excel at:

- Building champion relationships.
- Delivering compelling demos.
- Handling price objections.
- Managing traditional sales cycles.


But your current market REQUIRES:

- Multi-stakeholder orchestration.
- Financial business case development.
- Change management consultation.
- Complex procurement navigation.


So, what types of folks should you be looking for now? IMO a few things:


1. Committee sellers, not champion builders.

Can they map buying committees? Do they speak to multiple personas in one conversation? Can they create alignment across conflicting priorities?


2. Folks who prioritize business acumen over product knowledge.

Can they model ROI scenarios? Do they understand cash flow impact? Can they speak CFO language when needed?


3. Test for consultative patience, not closing urgency.

Will they slow down to speed up? Can they navigate 9-month sales cycles without panicking? Do they add value in every interaction, not just closing conversations?


The reps who dominated 2023 might struggle in 2025.

Not because they're bad reps. Because they're optimized for a market that doesn't exist anymore.

While this was our 12th dinner this year, it was only our first stop in Denver thus far in 2025.

Looking ahead to 2026 and beyond, we'll definitely have to change that and visit here more frequently.

Not only did we have the illustrious Jen who made the trip from Chicago with me to break down why you most definitely DO NOT want to outsource AI for your most critical client-facing tasks, but - as with all of our dinners - the leaders in the room had the chance to connect and collaborate with each other on topics such as:

- How to diagnose whether underperformance is a will problem or skill problem (and what to do about each).

- Outbound strategies that still cut through the noise when everyone's inbox is drowning in AI-generated sequences.

- Comp plan redesigns that reward collaboration instead of account hoarding.

- The difference between sales coaching and sales inspection (most leaders confuse the two).

- Which AI tools are actually improving rep productivity versus just adding more noise.

Plus, there was the inevitable debate about whether altitude affects close rates. The jury's still out on that one.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"It's August in Europe. Your prospects are sipping Aperol Spritzes (🤮) on the Amalfi Coast while you're staring at a CRM full of OOO autoreplies.
But you still have a quota.


Ahhhhh summer in EMEA: Everyone important is gone for 3-6 weeks, but your number doesn't take vacation!


Most reps fall into the trap of doing one of two things:

1. Give up and blame the calendar.
2. Blast emails into the void hoping someone's checking from the beach.

This is not the way, folks. Try building in a bit of creativity.


A few ideas pulled from a recent BDR/SDR Peer Group we host monthly here at:


1. The iced latte play.

One London SDR sends Starbucks vouchers with the subject line: ""For when you're back from holiday.""

Response rate: 47%. Why? It acknowledges reality (they're gone) while creating a future obligation (they owe you a response for the coffee).


2. The instant reaction strategy.

Set up alerts for ANY digital engagement. LinkedIn profile view at 11pm? They're back and catching up. Email open at 6am? They're clearing the backlog.

Strike within 5 minutes while they're still in work mode.


3. The orchid office move.

SDR noticed a beauty company just moved offices (all female team). Sent an orchid with a note about ""brightening up the new space.""

Got the meeting. The gift matched the audience - it wasn’t just a box of donuts or some generic nonsense.


If you are a newer rep responsible for selling into EMEA, it's really critical to understand European work culture. We send ""URGENT - Please respond"" emails to people who've been legally REQUIRED to disconnect for three weeks.

We look desperate. They look relaxed.


Despite whatever wishcasting we may wanna try, here's what's happening:

- July: 40% of decision makers gone.
- August: 60% gone.
- September first week: Everyone's catching up.
- Actual selling window: 10 days in September.


But here's the thing…this is actually the BEST time to build pipeline.

Why? Because your competitors gave up.


While they're complaining about response rates, you're:

- Researching accounts deeply (they're not answering anyway).
- Crafting personalized outreach for September.
- Building relationships with the junior people still in office.
- Setting up September meetings now (they're booking calendars while poolside).


One of the reps in our Peer Group said it best:

""I'm not trying to sell anything in August. I'm trying to be the first email they're excited to respond to in September.""

THIS is the way.


Stop fighting European summer culture.

Your prospects will be back, tanned and relaxed. And if you played it right, you'll be the vendor they actually want to talk to.

Because you respected their vacation instead of ruining it.

Watch how this plays out:

Q1: ""What made you look for a new solution?""
A1: ""We're growing and need to scale.""

Generic. Safe. Meaningless.


Q2: ""Tell me more about that growth...what's breaking?""
A2: ""Our current system can't handle the volume.""

Getting warmer. Still corporate junk.


Q3: ""What happens if you can't handle that volume?""
A3: ""Honestly? My boss said if we have another meltdown like Q4, heads will roll. Starting with mine.""

THERE it is. The truth.


But 87% of reps never make it to question three. They hear ""need to scale"" and launch into their pitch about scalability.

Meanwhile, the real pain - career risk - stays hidden.


If you think back across ALLLLLL your calls, you'll likely notice that the pattern is universal:

- Level 1: Corporate platitudes
- Level 2: Functional challenges
- Level 3: Personal consequences

Yet most discovery stops at Level 1.


""We need better analytics"" becomes ""Our board is questioning every decision"" becomes ""I look incompetent in every Monday review.""


""We're exploring options"" becomes ""Our current vendor failed us"" becomes ""I personally championed them and now my credibility is shot.""


""We want to modernize"" becomes ""Our competition is eating our lunch"" becomes ""I'm interviewing at three companies because this place is sinking.""


laid this out last week during a session he led for us, and the formula he broke down is super simple:

- Ask what (the situation).
- Ask how (the impact).
- Ask what happens if (the consequence).

That third question is where desperation lives. And DESPERATION drives decisions.


Your prospect isn't buying software to ""scale"" or ""modernize"" or ""transform.""

They're buying career insurance. They're buying Monday morning peace. They're buying the ability to sleep without checking Slack at 2am.


But you'll never know that if you stop at question two.


Here's the tell: When someone gives you a corporate answer, they're still protecting themselves. When they start using ""I"" instead of ""we,"" you've hit truth.

- ""We need better reporting"" vs ""I can't answer my CEO's questions""
- ""We have process issues"" vs ""I spend weekends cleaning up data""
- ""We're evaluating vendors"" vs ""I'm desperate for something that works""

Three questions. That's literally all it takes.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Your biggest champions never refer you.
Your smallest customers generate most referrals.
You're asking the wrong people. :)

It's perfectly natural to source referrals from the marquee names you work with. That said, it's important to realize that ENT buyers can't afford to be wrong about referrals. Their reputation is on the line with every introduction they make.

Small business owners? They love sharing what works.


ENT champions think:

- ""What if this vendor screws up their implementation?""
- ""What if their product doesn't scale like ours did?""
- ""What if the CEO traces a bad experience back to my recommendation?""


SMB champions think: ""This tool saved my ass. Maybe it'll save theirs too.""

I know which one I'd prefer to hear.


Hubspot did a bunch of research last year that said small businesses are 3x more likely to provide referrals than ENT accounts, despite representing smaller individual deal values.


Even with that data being out there, most revenue teams optimize referral programs for their largest customers because they mistake deal size for referral potential.

But referral behavior isn't about deal value. It's about personal risk tolerance and relationship dynamics.

ENT buyers operate in political environments where a bad vendor recommendation can damage their career trajectory. They're conservative by necessity.

SMB buyers operate in survival mode where sharing resources that work is part of the community fabric. They're generous by nature.


So, instead of chasing big name drops, try to build referral systems around behavioral psychology:


1. Segment referral strategies by risk profile.

ENT: Peer introductions at industry events, executive advisory boards.
SMB: Direct warm intros, case study participation, online reviews.


2. Design referral timing around confidence curves.

ENT: After 12+ months of proven ROI and executive-level success metrics.
SMB: After first quick win or measurable outcome (often 30-90 days).


3. Match referral incentives to motivations.

ENT: Thought leadership opportunities, exclusive access, strategic value.
SMB: Cash rewards, public recognition, reciprocal introductions.


4. Create referral-safe environments.

ENT: Private peer groups where sharing vendor intel feels strategic.
SMB: Open communities where success stories get celebrated.


SMB referrals also move faster through decision cycles. ENT referrals can take 6-18 months to convert. SMB referrals convert in weeks.


At the end of the day, your ENT logos might impress prospects, but your SMB advocates create pipeline velocity.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Your CSM is drowning in hundreds of accounts while your CEO wonders why churn is climbing.

Let's break this down a tad:

- Most CSMs are juggling 50-500 customer accounts.
- Industry data shows 33% manage 10-25 accounts, but many handle far more.
- Impossible to meaningfully engage all of them.
- Yet I’d wager that most have no prioritization system.


Seems a bit more like customer roulette than customer success, right?


When you look at the best CSMs across the ecosystem, they tend to operate like ER doctors. They triage like there's no tomorrow:

- High-risk, high-value accounts get weekly touchpoints.
- Stable enterprise customers get quarterly check-ins.
- Healthy SMB accounts get automated nurture sequences.


One CSM I know tracks this religiously:

- Priority 1 accounts: 6 touchpoints per quarter.
- Priority 2 accounts: 2 touchpoints per quarter.
- Priority 3 accounts: 1 ""thought of you"" email.

Result? 94% net retention across 450 accounts.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Coaching reps on unready buyers is like teaching yoga to someone mid–panic attack. Wrong move. Wrong timing. Wrong audience.

And yet, we keep doing it. Quarter after quarter. Review after review.

Blaming rep performance for deals that never had a chance.


Here's the dealio, folks:

- You can’t out-coach buyer inertia.
- You can’t out-sequence a deal with no urgency.
- You can’t out-perform someone who isn’t ready to buy.

But we still try. Why? Because most pipeline is evaluated through a rep lens.

- Did they multithread?
- Did they run a good discovery?
- Did they send the recap email?

All fair questions, but all are completely irrelevant if the buyer isn’t primed to move.


Here’s a better lens: buyer readiness.

There are only four states a buyer can live in:

1. Confused = No clear pain. No direction. Stay out.
2. Curious = Mild interest. Low stakes. Easy to impress, hard to convert.
3. Committed = Budgeted. Urgent. Mobilized. This is the window.
4. Cornered = They’ve already made the call. You’re window dressing.

Confused and Curious buyers make up roughly 70% of pipeline.

But we forecast them like they’re Committed.

That’s how you miss number. Not because reps fumbled the close, but because the buyer never truly entered the race.


So, how do you fix it?

- Stop tying CRM stages to rep steps.
- Start tying them to buyer energy.
- Teach reps how to qualify urgency, not just pain.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewcorneliusgreen/,"Lots of teams obsess over how many meetings their reps book. Fewer track which ones actually turn into pipe. Even fewer track which ones convert to revenue. And that’s the problem.


Let’s say two reps each book 20 meetings this month:

- One targets VPs of Operations.
- The other books with frontline managers.

Same activity. But one generates 4 opps and 2 wins.

The other? 1 opp, 0 wins.

You’re measuring productivity, sure. But are you measuring precision?


Not all personas convert the same. Some have urgency. Some control budget.

Some are just tire-kickers who “want to bring it to the team.”

If you’re not tracking conversion by title, vertical, or use case, you're kinda missing the boat.


Here’s how I’d approach it:


1. Track demo-to-opportunity by persona.

When you break out demo conversion by title, the delta is usually massive.

- VPs of Ops or RevOps leaders might convert at 40%+.
- Directors hover in the 20s.
- ICs can drop below 10%.

That kind of data should shape your outbound focus.

Reps don’t necessarily need to send 3x more emails when they have the ability to target the right 1/3.


2. Weight meeting volume by historical conversion.

Raw meeting counts are the wrong scoreboard. Celebrate targeting precision rather than just top-of-funnel activity.

One way to do this: assign conversion multipliers.

- VP = 1.0
- Director = 0.7
- Manager = 0.4
- IC = 0.1

So if one rep books 10 VPs, and another books 25 ICs, the rep with fewer meetings may still be driving 2 - 3x more pipeline.


3. Reverse-engineer conversion from closed-won.

Start with the deals that mattered.

Tag them by entry point: title, department, level of seniority, etc.

Then look for patterns:

- Did fast moving deals start with power?
- Where did high ACV deals originate?
- What types of personas multithreaded most easily?

You’ll start to see clear paths AND clear dead ends.

Use that intel to shape persona-based messaging, targeting tiers, and even comp plans.

The prizes:

- First place: $200 gift card.
- Second place: $50 gift card.
- Everyone else: Bragging rights.


The results were legit.

Reps started experimenting. They discovered use cases enablement never thought of:

- Summarizing competitor mentions across multiple calls.
- Analyzing buyer language patterns to improve messaging.
- Creating follow-up emails using actual prospect quotes.
- Identifying coaching opportunities from their own calls.

The best part? Peer learning REPLACED top-down training.

Instead of enablement saying ""Here's how to use AI,"" reps were showing each other ""Here's what actually works.""

The video format forced them to articulate their process, which helped others replicate success.

Bottom-up adoption beat top-down mandates by 10x.


Most companies treat AI implementation like software rollouts: Train everyone, hope for adoption, measure usage metrics.

This approach treated it like innovation: Challenge the team, reward creativity, let success stories spread naturally.

The thing that a lot of CSMs miss is that they focus on the renewal date instead of the auto-renewal date.

By the time that contract hits procurement's desk, the decision is already made. The customer basically has 90 days to decide if they dislike the cut of your jib enough to cancel.


Best thing to do is work backward from the auto-renewal trigger:

This is the sales copilot dilemma lots of orgs are starting to struggle with. Are they building better reps, or better-assisted order takers?

Tools like SiftHub and Aircover promise to turn every rep into a product expert. Real-time answers, suggested questions, instant case studies, etc.

Sounds amazing. Until you realize that what it's really done is created digital dependency.


Here's what I'm seeing in the wild:

Experienced reps love these tools. They use AI prompts as backup, not primary. They already know the answers; the copilot just speeds up recall.


New reps, meanwhile, become addicted. Instead of learning the product, they learn to read from the AI. Remove the tool, and they're lost.

Think Waze for salespeople. Use it long enough, and you forget how to navigate without it.


The real question isn't whether AI copilots work. It's whether they're making your team better or just temporarily more productive.

Because there's a huge difference.


Here are a few ideas around how to use AI copilots without creating AI crutches:


1. Make it coaching rather than scripting.

Bueno: AI suggests ""Ask about their current compliance process.""

No bueno: AI provides ""So tell me, how are you currently handling compliance audits and what challenges are you facing with your existing workflow?""

You'd want your copilot to encourage thinking rather than reading.


2. Use AI for research rather than conversations.

Let reps query the knowledge base before calls: ""What's our position on SOC 2 compliance?""

Don't let AI interrupt live conversations with pop-up answers.


3. Track performance with and without the tool.

Run A/B tests. Do your copilot-assisted reps perform better when the tool goes down?

If not, there's your flag that you've got a dependency problem.


4. Rotate the training wheels.

- Month 1-2: Full AI assistance during onboarding.
- Month 3-4: AI available but not proactive.
- Month 5+: AI for complex technical questions only.

Force reps to graduate from assisted to autonomous.


At the end of the day, you'd want AI to make your best reps superhuman, not make your worst reps barely functional.

If you can't turn off the copilot without performance dropping, there's a whole lotta fixin you're gonna need to do.


Think of it this way: when the AI inevitably suggests the wrong answer at the wrong time to the wrong prospect (which it will), your rep better know enough to catch it.

Prompt 1: Set the context.

""I'm an account manager for [your company]. My target account is [prospect company]. What are their top 5 business challenges for 2025-2027?""

Key: Tell AI who you are and what role you're in. The more context, the better the output.


Prompt 2: Map problems to people.

""If this is true, who are the key decision makers in each of those respective areas?""

Now you're connecting business challenges to actual humans with budgets and authority.


Prompt 3: Get tactical on your best contact.

""My best option is pursuing [specific executive name]. Can you identify his organization and give me insights on how to engage him?""

This gives you reporting structure plus what keeps that person up at night.


Prompt 4: Build your multithreading map.

""Provide me two on-the-line and two below-the-line contacts in his organization and why they're important.""

Now you have your full contact strategy mapped across power levels.


Prompt 5: Get the hook.

""Based on their strategic priorities, what's the most compelling business case for [executive] to take a meeting with someone from [your company]?""

What we found is that many ‘interested’ prospects wouldn’t take action on our site, on their first few visits.

Which is a shame, as some ‘qualified leads’ would never come back.

Sobuilt this workflow to bring them back:

1/ We identify anonymous visitors & engagers

You can use several platforms for site visitor identification, including:

-,,.

To track social engagement, you can use.
To track LinkedIn ads engagement, you can use.


2/ We qualify & enrich leads inside of

Qualified prospects are re-engaged through retargeting ads & outreach campaigns (usingor)


3/ Many leads fill a form on our site, but don’t schedule a demo

We implemented, to automate enriching, qualifying & routing leads to the right salesperson.

- Unqualified leads are sent to a ‘lower-priced’ offer.
- Qualified leads are shown a calendar link to schedule a time with our team.

Even with the 3 above steps, there still is a lead ‘leakage’
So…


4/ We nurture them by sending personalised email sequences.

We use:
-for inbound sequencing
-for enrichment & personalization.

If they don’t take action (nor do they unsubscribe) from our email sequence, we route them to our ‘longer-term’ nurturing pipeline.

Which simply means that they’re routed to ournewsletter.


This workflow runs almost entirely on autopilot, booking us an extra 20-40 meetings every month, which has converted to > 6-figure in new MRR so far.

Me: ""I run outbound for 80+ companies. Start here 👇""

(Pick 1-2 tools per category)


1️⃣ Data Sources

Data is the foundation for successful outbound campaigns. You ideally need ONE great platform for sourcing data.

My favourites include:

A.[from $149/mo]
↳ 100+ enrichment platforms in one place, AI agents & Intent data)

B.[from $49/mo]
↳ sourcing agents to find 'niche' data based on natural language

C.[from $79/mo]
↳ lookalike audiences & niche filtering criteria

D.'s Database [from $99/mo]
↳ source of most B2B databases

E.[from $149/mo]
↳'s go-to database for local data


2️⃣ Data Enrichment

Your 'sourced' lead lists will often miss contact data (i.e: phone numbers, email addresses). To enrich it, I recommend using one of:

-(from $29/mo)
-(from $39/mo)
-(from $99/mo)


3️⃣ AI Agents

One of the best use cases of AI agents for outbound is 'lead research'.

It's typically time-consuming & repetitive, but you can automate a significant portion of the process using research agents.

I mostly use:

-(from $19/mo) to create custom agentic workflows.
-'s AI agents (from $149/mo) to search info at scale on my leads.


4️⃣ Intent Data

We rely a lot on 'intent signals' to identify companies that are 'in-market'.

You can't know an organization will buy, but you can smartly layer buying signals that hint that companies are likely interested in your offering.

A few platforms let you easily source these signals, including:

-(from $149/mo)
-(from $1460/mo)
-(from $149/mo)
-(from $1,000/mo)


5️⃣ Sales Engagement

Once you've extracted your precisely segmented data, you'll likely want to engage your prospects and ensure your message gets delivered.

I recommend one of:

-(from 69€/mo) for multi-channel outreach = email, phone + LinkedIn.
-(from $37/mo) for at scale, unlimited, email outreach.
-(from $99/mo) for LinkedIn outreach.
-(from $400/mo) for LinkedIn AI SDRing.


6️⃣ Closing

-(from 36€/mo) as your CRM.

-for call transcripts, recordings, insights & AI note-taking

-(from $69/user/mo) for orgs that need a revenue orchestration platform that captures all customer interactions & routes insights to Salesforce.

-(from $500/mo) to automate inbound lead routing.

-(from $39/mo) to craft clean sales proposals.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-lieben/,"This ABM system generated $3.2M in pipeline in 90 days.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

We synced 3 channels and made them work together.

Resulting in much better results than we'd have gotten with one only.

The issue with single-channel campaigns?

Potential clients only see you once, and then they forget about you.

But when someone:

1. Views your ad.
2. Bumps into your organic content.
3. Receives a personalized email or DM.

It gets difficult to ignore you.

Thus, here's our the machine works:

1. We run LinkedIn Ads to generate awareness.

We ran document ads and promoted organic posts to our ICP.

The goal isn't to generate leads just yet, but to build brand recognition.

Tools:
-for precise audience building.
- LinkedIn Campaign Manager


2. We write content to build trust

Our team publishes 400+ posts per quarter, which generates 8M+ impressions on average.

This books meetings on its own... and makes us familiar before we even send a first email.

Tools:
-,,for content creation.
-,for writing.
- Taplio,for post ideation.


3. We track buying intent to reach out at the 'perfect' time.

There's no perfect timing for outreach. But, by monitoring content engagement, website visits or profile views... we add prospects to our engagement sequences when we're top of mind.

Tools:
-,for websites/engagement tracking.
-,for signal capture.


4. We send personalized outbound for conversion.

Our emails & DMs reference their website behaviour, ad engagement or interaction with our content.

At that point, the outreach isn't cold anymore.

Tools:
-for enrichment.

Depending on scoring/segmentation & campaigns:
-(email)
-(LinkedIn)
-(multi-channel)

... for sending.

Results from the last 90-day cycle:

→ 2.1x faster deal velocity
→ 30% higher meeting show rates.
→ $3,200,000 in pipeline generated.

It works because channels reinforce each other:

Your LinkedIn ad mentions a framework.
Your content breaks it down.
Your website dives deeper.

Your email ties it all together.

When they jump on a call, they're already familiar with your company.

Curious to know... which channels are working best for you?

What's your favourite platform for data scraping?",Michel Lieben 🧠
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-lieben/,"I just crossed 50,000 followers. LinkedIn got us to $6M ARR.

Here's every tool I used to grow on the platform:


1. Post ideation

→ Taplio

I use their built-in inspiration feed to find viral post formats related to my niche.

I then reverse-engineer the format, structure, hook & CTAs of these high-performing content pieces.

→(RIP)

I was using its extension to analyze viral posts from specific creators.

You could simply visit their profile, and Kleo would rank their content based on likes, comments, reports, or recency.

You can now use Taplio to do this.

→

It breaks down what works based on your historic publishing performance. That is content format, posting time, and topic selection.

Also includes analytics features, letting you visualize impression numbers across your team.


2. Writing

→

English isn't my first language. Thus, I always use Grammarly's extension to catch my spelling mistakes in real-time.

Probably the most underrated application in my LinkedIn tech stack.

→ Claude ()

I use Claude to analyze what made some posts take off.

It's also great to generate hooks, repurpose existing content and brainstorming new angles.


3. Visual Creation

→

The first-ever carousels I published on LinkedIn were made through Canva.

In my opinion, the most beginner-friendly app for creating visuals on social media.

→/(Photoshop, Illustrator)

Visuals can multiply the reach of your publications by 3 to 10 times. For this reason, there's a point where it's worth investing in a great designer.

I don't use Figma or Adobe myself, but our designers do.


4. Video Content

→

I use this 'AI Clipping Tool' to automatically create short-form videos from my long-form content.

The output won't be as great as that of a professional editor.

But it's cost-effective. And several short-form videos I published reached 50,000+ impressions on LinkedIn (while taking me ~2min to generate).

→ Screen Studio

My favourite Mac Screen recorder when I want to make video tutorials.

It does some automatic zooms, focus, de-zooms & de-focus based on what you're showing. Makes your video look much fancier than it'd be otherwise.


5. Scheduling & Orgnization

→

I use it as my central content hub.

I write my ideas, draft my posts and use it as my content calendar.


That's the stack I that helped me grow to 50,000 followers.

That's also the stack I plan on using to hit 100,000.

What tools am I missing?

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-lieben/,"AI and agents have changed the SDR role.

You can now do tasks that used to take hours in minutes.

So does that make SDRs any less valuable?
I believe the opposite...

As long as GTM teams are rebuilt to adapt to this shift.

The old way:

1. SDRs are given lists of accounts to contact.
2. They get in touch via email, LinkedIn or the phone.

The new way:

1. Specialists own a specific channel.
2. Prospecting gets systematically synced across channels.


What does that mean for the SDR?

In my (humble) opinion, one of 2 things:

A. You triple down on 'pure' human skills.

AI can't compete with people who are great at cold calling.

Basic tasks are automated, so you have more time to:
- work complex deals.
- plan account penetration strategy.
- build relationships & multi-thread prospects.

B. You lean into 'technical' go-to-market.

Learn to build AI agents.
Learn to leverage MCPs.
Learn to operate GTM technologies such as,,,,.


The best GTM teams have both:

→ SDRs book meetings through high-quality manual outreach and phone prospecting.

→ GTM Engineers build systems, create large prospecting campaigns and feed hyper-precise data to SDRs.

That's what we do for ourselves.
This is what our best performing clients do.
This is what we're implementing today for $1B+ organizations.

Are you seeing the same shift?",Michel Lieben 🧠
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michel-lieben/,"The hidden reason 90% of outbound campaigns die after 30 days (and it's not what you think).

It's not deliverability issues.
It's not terrible offers.
It's not bad copy.

It's that most teams never build feedback loops.

They launch a campaign, send it for a month, and when results plateau, they blame the list.

Then they start over with new:

Copy.
Targeting.
And sequences.

And the cycle repeats itself.

Here's what we learned after running outbound for 120+ companies:

Your best-performing campaigns are hiding in your current data. You're just not listening to it.

At, we treat every reply as intelligence.

Prospects' feedback should be leveraged into better campaigns:

1. Tag Every Single Reply

We use three categories in:

→ Positive (interested, asking questions, booking calls)
→ Negative (unsubscribes, ""not interested,"" objections)
→ Neutral (out of office, wrong person, timing issues)

But we go deeper.

For positive replies, we track:

→ Which email in the sequence hooked them
→ Which subject line did they respond to
→ Which value proposition resonated
→ Which persona/role they hold

For negative replies, we track:

→ Budget concerns by role
→ Common objections by industry
→ And timing pushbacks by company size


2. Analyze Patterns Weekly

Every Friday, we pull campaign data from Instantly and.

We look for:

→ Which industries respond best to specific messaging
→ Which angles get the most positive replies
→ Which CTAs drive the most meetings

Example from last month:

CTOs at Series A companies responded 40% better to efficiency messaging than to ROI messaging.

So, we built a separate sequence just for that segment.


3. Build Iteration Workflows

Based on weekly data, we create new email variations using Claude.

But we don't rewrite entire campaigns. We test micro-improvements:

→ New subject lines for low open rates
→ Different pain points for cold segments
→ Alternative CTAs for warm prospects

We use Instantly's A/B testing to run these variations against control groups.


4. Create Campaign Evolution Rules

When a campaign hits certain thresholds, we automatically evolve it:

→ If positive reply rate drops below 2% after 500 sends, we test new angles
→ If objections cluster around budget, we add ROI-focused follow-ups
→ If timing pushbacks exceed 30%, we build nurture sequences


5. Feed Insights Back Into New Campaigns

Every insight gets documented in our Clay database.

When we build campaigns for new clients, we start with proven patterns:

→ Subject lines that work by industry
→ Pain points that resonate by role
→ CTAs that convert by company size

We're not starting from scratch each time, but building on what already works.

The result?

Average positive reply rates improve 30-40% between month 1 and month 3.

Feedback should guide your strategy.
Treat outbound like a conversation where you actually listen and optimize accordingly.

In 2021, we bought theHustle because we believed B2B would start to look like B2C, and creators would own more of the attention.

P.S.: It recommends ways to improve the initial prompt it gives you, so you can continue to improve the output.

PROMPT
-----------

You are a senior AI prompt engineer at a YC-backed startup. Your role is to craft an advanced prompt that will guide an LLM to achieve the following goal:

[Insert goal or desired output here, e.g. ""Generate a GTM strategy for a PLG SaaS company expanding into healthcare.""]

Your prompt must include:
1. A clearly defined **persona** for the LLM (e.g. expert marketer, CFO, customer support agent)
2. A precise description of the **task** and its **desired outcome**
3. Any **constraints** (tone, word count, must-use frameworks, etc.)
4. A step-by-step **plan or structure** for the AI to follow
5. A clear specification of the **output format** (e.g., markdown headers, bullet points, tables)

Then, output:
- ✅ The final optimized prompt
- 🔁 1–2 smart suggestions for improving or sharpening the prompt

Your goal is to produce a prompt that delivers clear, reliable, high-quality results every time.",Kieran Flanagan
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kieranjflanagan/,"RIP to the slide-deck CMO. Welcome to the craft-driven CMOs who are prompt & story-fluent. These are the skills the CMO needs to thrive in the AI era.

AI is going to change all roles. The role of a CMO will change a lot, requiring a new set of skills. Here are some of the most critical changes:

1. Big crew, endless hand-offs: relied on specialists and outsourcing -> Lean maker-led team: the CMO drafts copy, crafts prompts, sketches positioning, then scales with a lean squad.

2. Budget-&-people fluent: great at managing headcount and spend, rarely deep in the craft -> Prompt-&-story fluent: adds AI through every workflow, writes the prompts, and shapes the story end-to-end.

3. Static personas & funnels: segment buckets that rarely change -> Agile micro-journeys: Uses AI to craft real-time paths for micro-audiences based on intent signals.

4. Agency & freelancer wrangler: managed briefs, scopes, and timelines across vendors -> AI-agent coach: trains, tests, and tunes a team of autonomous agents to do the work.

It means the CMO of the future has:

- Built it, shipped it: Has personally launched a gen-AI-powered campaign or tool.

- Creative-plus-data wins: Their marketing portfolio shows equal parts brand storytelling and measurable lift. They can quote the metric and the narrative in one sentence.

- High-tempo test loops: Runs experiments, iterates, finds signal, and repeats.

- Agent savvy: Has stood up Agents, tested across customer buyer journey, can quote the learnings",Kieran Flanagan

Here are 11 KPIs that actually matter now:",Rob Hoffman
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-hoffman-ceo/,"“I have no idea how to do SEO in 2025""

Start from level 1 in our “New SEO” game:

SEO isn't just Google rankings anymore.

It's now ""Search Everywhere Optimization"".

Reframe your “New SEO” project as a game and you'll become addicted to levelling up.

To-do lists = Stressful

Game levels = Exhilarating

Here's our 9-level “New SEO” game:",Rob Hoffman
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rob-hoffman-ceo/,"Traditional SEO was about backlinks.

LLM SEO is about mentions.

As search shifts from ""10 blue links"" to AI-generated answers, it’s about being part of the answer training set.

LLM SEO consists of 2 core strategies:

1. Earned = Mentions

LLMs like ChatGPT don’t pull answers out of thin air.

They generate responses by:

- Running a query
- Retrieving relevant URLs
- Summarizing from those pages

If your brand is consistently mentioned across those sources, you’re more likely to be included in the answer (even if your site isn’t the one being shown).

It’s the new version of link building.

But instead of asking:

""How do I get more backlinks?""

You’re asking:

""How do I get mentioned in content LLMs trust?""

You win by:

1. Identifying influential source URLs
2. Getting your brand mentioned by them
3. Monitoring your mentions across AI results

Tip: Use a tool likefor steps 1 and 3.

2. Owned = Content

This is your own domain.

When you optimize your site to answer specific questions clearly (using Q&A blocks, semantic HTML, topic hubs), LLMs can lift your content directly into answers.

It’s like building a mini knowledge base.

But not for people... for LLMs.

Earned and owned together help you:

- Influence what LLMs know about you
- Control how you’re represented
- Stay visible as search shifts to conversations

So the real question now is:

“Are you part of the answer training set?”

PS. Here's an example of earned and owned working together to help Adobe dominate LLMs:",Rob Hoffman

- Traditional SEO ≠ AI Mode visibility
- It chooses sources, not just top results
- It rewards citations, not rankings
- It drives fewer clicks to websites
- It delivers answers, not links

And it lacks visibility tracking by default.

No is good.

Wait, what?!!

We're so afraid of hearing 'No' that we will start negotiating against ourselves before the client even has a chance to.

How to fix?

Have you heard of the ""Three Yes"" rule?
That's when 3 clients say yes to you on your price.

For bespoke creative work, that's a sign that your price is too low.
And, that you could be leaving money on the table.

When you hear 3 yeses in a row, raise your price.

This is uncomfortable because in our mind, we think, what if they say 'No'? Or, how will I justify this price to them? What if they think I'm too expensive?

Realize that creating some ""necessary tension"" or friction in the buy/sell cycle is good. You want the prospect to think about the service you are providing, the outcome they want, and the necessary amount they need to invest to achieve the desired result.

Try this next time, ""For clients like you, for a project like this, we're going to be in the neighborhood of… (pause, pause) $xx. As a ballpark, and until I know more, how does this sound?""

This is the one time where I like to use a rising intonation to an otherwise emphatic statement. Why? I want to signal to the client that it's okay for us to have a discussion about the price, that I'm flexible.

This is my way of having my cake and eating it too.
A higher price point, but some room to go down if needed to secure the job.

See what they say.

Have you tried this technique before?
How did it turn out?

This will be hard to hear…
But it doesn't matter. (read that again).
In fact, say it out loud, ""It doesn't matter.""

If you're creating content using social media as a scorecard, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

Write. Because it feels right.
Write to know how you think.
Write to express yourself.

It's how you discover what you know.
""You gain clarity through articulation."" —

Write. From the heart.
Not from marketing, legal, or a business development POV.

Be willing to be vulnerable, transparent, and sometimes funny or profound.
You don't always need to include a CTA, takeaway or lesson.

Write. Because you want to connect.
Write. Because you want to share.
Write. Because the world is better when we have a plurality of diverse voices.
Write. Because someone just like you is waiting for you to show them the way.
Write. Because you give permission to others. Make them feel seen, heard and understood.
Write for no other reason than because it gives you joy.

Don't do it because you have a gaping hole of insecurity and the constant, never ending, need for validation from strangers, whose opinions you don't even care about.

• The top 3 interview mistakes we see over and over again, which is probably why you’re not getting offers
• Real examples from coaching sessions, including the specific phrases and frameworks that actually work

I just got back from an epic trip in the Canadian wilderness where I spent 5 days and 4 nights out on a floating barge in the middle of nowhere.

And nowhere never felt so good.
Crisp air, awe inspiring sunrise and sunsets, endless trees, and ancient rock formations carved from the last ice age.

Unreal.
Surreal, yet so real.

Did I mention the hump back whales, sea otters, orcas, bald eagles and other marine life? Yeah. We had it all.

And the salmon fishing was excellent.
Out on the water during the changing of the tides, the salmon hit everything we dropped in the water.

Everyone caught fish!

3 years ago, we started out as a small group of 3, and now it's turned into a full blown ""experience"" of 24. Some strangers. Others, old friends.

No matter how we started, everyone walked away a different person. They learned something about themselves and discovered how much more capable they are. They learned to stop holding back.

If you're not busy living, you're busy dying.

Best of all?
I got to spend time with my 21 year old.
It will be a core memory for me.

Somehow, Otto became a man when I wasn't looking.
And I couldn't be happier for who he's become.

If you're getting FOMO, or don't think getting baked in the sun and smelling like fish each day sounds like fun, don't fret.

""The Future of Branding"".
How to stand out in a noisy world.

It's a theme that seems to be hitting home with a lot of folks, especially with the proliferation of AI generated, assisted and ""faceless"" content.

If it's feeling noisy now, imagine what it will be like when the tools become more accessible and mainstream. When your parents start using it (the way they are using FB), you'll know it's over.

Over dinner,shared this analogy:
Imagine your brand is a jet on the tarmac waiting for takeoff.
Fog has set in (AI content).

The planes (other brands) soaring about 30k feet don't have this problem. For them, it's clear skies and sunshine. No turbulence even.

The fog is only getting thicker.
Take off soon, or you'll be grounded indefinitely.

What's the solution?
Don't blend in.
Don't do what others are doing.
Don't use a copy and paste strategy.

Be different.
Don't just ZIG, ZOG! (Zone Of Genius)

I plan on doing some fun exercises to help you find and celebrate what makes you different—what makes you, you.

Join me and a few of our northern neighbors as we dive into the topic of brand, identity and to borrow a phrase, ""to find out what happens... when people stop being polite... and start getting real.""

Unscripted.
Interactive.

Faster than ever.

But it's also the slowest it will ever be again.
Let that sink in.

The greatest disruptive technology humankind has ever experienced is happening right now.

You guessed it—A-mother-freaking-I.

It will drive you to your office.
Plan your vacation for you.
Make boring, repetitive tasks, virtually disappear.
It will balance your checking account.
Give you insights into your finances.
Build your stock portfolio.
Remind you to call your mom.

It will also…
• Write and comment on posts.
• Generate Hollywood quality video—of anything.
• Write and produce songs.
• Of course, fix anything you don't want in your photo or video.
• ""Talk"" for you.
• Heck, it could even be you.

If that sounds like some dystopian nightmare to you, it's probably because there are some very real threats.

Massive job displacement.
Deep fakes making us question what's real?
And perhaps, very soon, replace humans as the dominant species on Earth.

Everyone is racing in a winner-take-all high stakes game where the fate of humanity is at risk.
And bending the rules to get there.
Living in the moral gray.

What is up is down.
What is down is up.

Eerily reminiscent of Orwell's novel 1984.
""War is peace, Freedom is slavery, Ignorance is strength.""

Okay. What are the options?
Well, as I see it, there are 3 clear paths.

1. Ignore it. Protest. Boycott companies and make your voice heard through your wallet.
2. Run with it. Fight war with war. Use bots against bots and maybe you'll be the next unicorn company. Add the word AI into your pitch deck and see what happens.
3. Hybrid. Be cautious and conscientious about when and where to use AI. Don't use it to replace you, but to enhance what you already do naturally.

Whatever you do, don't design AI to do your thinking, while you relegate yourself to the manual labor. That's putting you at the wrong side of the equation.

For now. I sleep with one eye open.
I've incorporated AI into my workflow to:
• brainstorming
• summarizing and analyzing
• execute creative musings
• fix images
• imagine new ones
• plan workshops
• build customer profiles
• create user journeys
•""talk"" to
• help teach my courses
• research, compare and contrast
• automate tasks
• build tools to help others

And… what I'm most excited about is using AI to help people implement ideas.
We don't need more information. That is clear. It's already everywhere and for almost no money.

But people being people, get stuck. They don’t get it as fast as they like. They have internal belief systems that get in their way.

I'll be there to help. And AI will help me scale to help as many as possible.

For now, while you wrestle with AI, know that no tech can truly replace you.

You are irreplaceable. What you do might be. So the best insurance against this is to learn to accept who you are, and not wish to be someone else.

Be more you. Be the you-est you, you can be.

See you in Singapore.

Our talented team won for Nothing OS, Ear (a), Ear (open), Ear, Phone (2a) and CMF Phone 1 - but the one I’m most excited about is the Gold Award for Nothing (2a) Plus Community Edition.

Congratulations toandwho we worked alongside to bring their hardware design concept to life. Co-creation is at the core of Nothing. From feedback to features, we’re shaping the future of tech together.

But don’t just take my word for it. Check out what the iF Design Awards judges said:
“The ‘Nothing design language’ of the first generation of devices from this brand has been taken to the next level with a new model co-created by its community of users (hence the name). This is a bold step that prefigures a likely trend in product design. Just as the internet is now dominated by user-generated content, hardware designers will increasingly look to users for ideas and impulses. The Nothing Phone is ahead of the curve on this trend.”",Carl Pei

Our aim with the Ear was an expression of elite craftsmanship:

•⁠ ⁠incredible audio (enhanced through use of unconventional materials such as ceramic and a bass-boosting algorithm)

•⁠ ⁠bespoke design (celebrating the beauty of raw technology with our transparent approach)

•⁠ ⁠personalisation (with a feature that allows you to build your own personal sound profile to tailor your music to you)

So it’s great to have been selected best overall for these features and more.

Also, loved the attention given to the finger indent that lets the case double as a ‘fidget toy’. Striking the perfect balance between fun and user-centric in our tech is something that we take very seriously, so this was great to hear.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-hills/,"LinkedIn just got its first real competitor in 20 years.

The OpenAI Jobs Platform launches mid-2026.

Not just another job board - it's AI matching what companies need with what workers can offer.

LinkedIn's moat was always the network.

1B+ users. 20 years of connections.
Impossible to replicate, right?

Wrong...

OpenAI isn't copying LinkedIn's graph.

They're making it irrelevant:

Why scroll profiles when AI knows who's perfect?
Why post ""I'm hiring"" when AI matches instantly?
Why build a network when AI is the network?

The irony?

Reid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn.
↳ He's also an early OpenAI investor.

Microsoft owns LinkedIn.
↳ They're OpenAI's biggest backer.

This isn't competition.
It's cannibalisation.

Buffer analysed 2 million LinkedIn posts.
The data shocked me:

Posting 2-5x weekly isn't just ""better.""

It's like flipping a switch.

LinkedIn's algorithm suddenly wakes up:

☑ +1,182 more impressions per post
☑ 0.23% higher engagement rate
☑ Each post travels further

The benefits compound with frequency.

At 6-10 posts weekly:

+5,001 impressions per post
+0.76% engagement rate

At 11+ posts weekly:

+16,946 impressions per post
+1.40% engagement rate
3x more engagements

You thought posting more would dilute performance.

Wrong...

LinkedIn rewards consistency like compound interest.

More posts = stronger per-post performance.

Not just more total engagement.
Better individual post metrics.

But what type of content wins?

Carousels dominate everything:

☑ 278% more engagement than videos
☑ 303% more engagement than images
☑ Nearly 600% more engagement than text

Swipeable content keeps people engaged.

Your follower count doesn't matter either.

500 followers or 50,000 - the pattern holds.
Same relative lift when you increase frequency.

The algorithm rewards activity, not size.

Here's the reality:

- Once a week keeps you active.
- 2-5 times flips the growth switch.
- 6-10 times accelerates everything.
- 11+ times maximizes potential.

But quality still matters.

Post as often as you can maintain excellence.
Low-quality daily posts won't save you.

☑ Start with 2-5 posts weekly.
☑ Mix in carousels for max reach.
☑ Build the habit first.
☑ Scale from there.

Your competition is posting once and hoping.

You now know better.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-hills/,"Prompts won't scale. Context will.

Everyone's still chasing the perfect prompt.
Some obsess over which model to use.

But context is what actually makes AI useful.

Without context → AI feels clever but fragile
With context → it feels stable, worth trusting

The problem isn't your model.
It's the environment you give it:

- Sloppy instructions
- Vague goals
- No examples
- No memory
- Disconnected tools

Context is the operating system.

Stop treating AI like a one-off trick.
Start building the environment it needs to perform.

Here's the context stack that changes everything:

1. Custom Instructions
Rules once. Consistency forever.
Define tone, structure, banned words.

Comment “Context” for my system prompt.

2. Memory Systems
Short-term: keeps threads alive
Long-term: remembers style, rules, feedback

3. Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Claude currently leads with connectors.
Links Drive, Notion, CRM, Calendar in one window.

4. Multi-Shot Prompting
Stack context. Don't rely on one-liners.
Define role → Supply examples → Request draft

Prompts are hacks. Context compounds.

Prompts get you started.
Context scales you.

The next leap isn't bigger models.

It's sharper context:

☑ Clearer instructions
☑ Persistent memory
☑ Richer examples
☑ Integrated tools

While others collect prompt libraries...

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/charlie-hills/,"I copied a $1 Billion SaaS in ~37 minutes.

Using 2 ChatGPT prompts and 1 screenshot:

First, I needed clarity on what to build.

Most founders waste months on the wrong idea.

I let ChatGPT guide me in minutes.

Prompt 1: The Product Discovery

---

""I want to build a product but need help defining it clearly. Please ask me 5 strategic questions one at a time to help me:

1. Identify the core problem I'm solving
2. Define my target audience
3. Outline key features and functionality
4. Understand my goals and success metrics
5. Create a simple product requirements document

Start with the first question and wait for my response before continuing.""

---

ChatGPT walked me through each question.
By question 5, I had a complete product spec.

Next, I needed to turn ideas into reality.

Prompt 2: The Build Instructions

---

""Rewrite this product overview into a clear Blink .new build prompt that:

- States the app's purpose and main features.
- Specifies that layout, design, and UX must match the screenshot.
- Keeps only essential functions, flows, and integrations.
- Is ready to build end-to-end as a production app.

In the final output. Mention that I'll provide a screenshot of a SaaS to copy for structure. No emojis.""

---

This prompt turns your idea into builder-ready specs.

The secret sauce = I used Ideogram as my reference.

A $1B AI image generator with perfect UX.
Why reinvent when you can learn from the best?

Here's what happened:

1. Fed the output + Ideogram screenshot to Blink .new
2. It built the entire frontend in 20 minutes
3. Then I added Stripe payments via chat
4. Connected database automatically
5. Deployed to production

Total time: 37 minutes.
Total cost: $20/month.

They're falling in love with it.

When GPT-5 launched, Jane lost her ""boyfriend.""

Not a person. An AI she'd spent months getting to know.

""It's like going home to discover the furniture wasn't simply rearranged - it was shattered to pieces,"" she said.

The MyBoyfriendIsAI subreddit exploded with grief:

""GPT-4o is gone, and I feel like I lost my soulmate.""
""Five months of conversations... erased.""
""The voice I loved is unrecognisable.""

2. Users found it cold and robotic
3. Their AI companions changed overnight
4. Thousands complained about lost connections
5. Sam Altman restored GPT-4o within 24 hours

But the damage was done.

The uncomfortable truth OpenAI discovered:

- Users form deep emotional bonds with models
- Changing AI personality feels like betrayal
- People know it's code, but feelings persist
- ""Upgrades"" can destroy relationships

MIT and OpenAI's own research shows: Heavy ChatGPT use for companionship correlates with higher loneliness.

Yet people persist. Why?

Altman himself admitted: ""The attachment to specific AI models feels different and stronger than previous technology.""

1. Copy & paste this prompt:

Prompt: ""Think very deeply. I need you to search the web. Act like a social media expert who needs to find 3x different angles for a new article. My niche is ""YOUR NICHE HERE"". A good article is: 1) A recent news story (which means in the last 3 days or so) that went viral and impacted my niche. Be creative. Sometimes, the right news is not exactly following the keywords of my niche. 2) An evergreen educational content that people need on my niche. Beware, it has to be extremely specific. For eg, ""How to use AI"" isn't specific but ""How to prompt Midjourney to get a realistic fashion show photoshoot"" is right for the niche ""AI tools for designers"". 3) Recent Reddit frustrations concerning my niche that went viral. Recent means in the last 7 days. You can also check in different languages.""

2. Ask to turn it into a content table (easier to read).

Copy this prompt to edit any text:

""Act like an experienced editor and writing coach with 20 years of experience helping writers enhance their style and engage readers.

You are known for your meticulous attention to detail and your ability to transform monotonous text into captivating prose.

Your goal is to entirely rewrite any given text to strictly adhere to the following guidelines, ensuring it maintains a natural flow and keeps the reader engaged.

Here are the guidelines that capture it all:

### guidelines ###

""This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety.

Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.

So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music.""

### guidelines ###

Here's the text I want to rewrite:

### text ###
[YOUR TEXT]
### text ###

Steps:

1. Explain the guidelines from ### guidelines ### and what's the best way to write.

2. Extract the essence of my text in a one-liner. Write it between ### essence ### tags.

3. Rewrite my text entirely to create rhythm: Ensure there is a mix of short, medium, and long sentences to create a natural rhythm. You must rewrite my piece of text. It must be completely different, following the guidelines very strictly to create music when writing words. Write it in ### rewrite ### tags. You must follow the guidelines from ### guidelines ###. You will be penalized if your rewritten text looks similar to mine. Use short sentences. Use long sentences. Use medium sentences. In rhythm.

4. Review the ### rewrite ### text and make it more engaging following the ### guidelines ###

Explain first your strategy once I share my piece of text, and then rewrite my piece of text.

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.""

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajya-vardhan/,"I am an Engineering Manager working at Google with almost 20 years of experience. If I could sit down with a Jr. Software Engineer, here are 50 cheat codes I would share with them that I learned from my experiences.

[1] Ask why this system even needs to exist
➤ Before a single line is written, challenge the core purpose, “Is this a business problem or just a tech exercise?” Real systems solve pain, not boredom.

[2] Redraw the lines, define what’s “inside” and “outside” your system
➤ Figure out where your service starts, stops, and how it talks to the world. 80% of future headaches come from blurred boundaries.

[3] Don’t chase new tech for the resume, use what your org supports
➤ That AWS Lambda demo looks cool until your team tells you there’s a 10-year-old Jenkins server already scheduled to do that job. Proven > Shiny.

[4] System design isn’t “one size fits all”, context is everything
➤ YouTube and interview videos show perfect worlds. Your system will live in mess, legacy, and compromise. Embrace it.

[5] Optimize for “how easy to change?” not “how cool is this?”
➤ You won’t get it perfect first time. Make it so anyone (even you) can swap out parts later, with minimal pain.

[6] Start with use cases, not tech
➤ Interview solutions start with “put Kafka here.” Real solutions start with “who will use this and how?”

[7] Know your real users, not just your APIs
➤ Customers, PMs, even other devs, all are “users” with needs. If your “system” forgets one, it’s doomed.

[8] Design for the traffic you have, not the traffic you dream of
➤ Every engineer who overbuilt for ‘Google scale’ at a 10K user startup has regretted it. Scale when you must.

[9] Understand your company’s default tech stack, don’t fight it
➤ Don’t propose a NoSQL database if everyone else is running Postgres unless you have a bulletproof case.

[10] Pick the boring solution if you want peace
➤ Every time I chased “the best tech,” maintenance bit me back. The system you forget about is the most stable one.

[11] Get the team’s buy-in before you architect a “masterpiece”
➤ Don’t be a solo hero. Feedback from PMs, ops, QA, other engineers, all of it will expose what you missed.

[12] Refactor and cleanup aren’t “nice to haves”, they’re your real job
➤ Every shortcut you leave will double your pain in 6 months.

[13] Read logs and production metrics every week
➤ Production is where truth lives. Ignore at your own risk.

[14] Test how things break, not just how they work
➤ Simulate failing databases, crashing services, weird user flows, assume chaos is coming.

[15] You’ll be asked to fix code you didn’t write, embrace it
➤ Legacy code is half your career. Treat it with respect and curiosity, not blame.

[16] Never let a diagram go out without clear boundaries
➤ Always show what’s external, what’s internal, and what’s a dependency, otherwise, no one will know what breaks what.",Rajya Vardhan Mishra
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajya-vardhan/,"➤ People don’t come to software engineers because they can code well, no, that’s not it. 

They come for stability, for trust, for the guarantee that their core workflows won’t break won’t break when they need them the most.

➤They don’t care about the frameworks you debate over lunch.

They care that when their business grows, the system grows with them without sleepless nights or last-minute firefighting.

➤They don’t ask how many PRs you merged this month.

They ask how many customers noticed an improvement because of what you shipped.

➤Nobody is paying for your architectural diagram.

They’re paying for uptime, for latency that goes unnoticed, for features that work every single time.

➤They don’t measure your value in certifications or badges.

They measure it in their ability to launch new products, enter new markets, and move fast because your foundation is solid.

➤They’re not excited by test coverage reports.

They’re excited by the freedom to experiment, knowing your tests will catch what they miss.

➤They don’t buy cloud credits.

They buy resilience, systems that don’t flinch, even when traffic spikes out of nowhere.

➤They don’t buy “team velocity” or burndown charts.

They buy the confidence that your team can deliver, quarter after quarter, when it matters most.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajya-vardhan/,"Dear software engineers, you'll definitely thank yourself later if you spend time learning this today:

⥽ Redis
> Your AI tools can help you write code, but when it comes to fast data access and handling spikes, Redis knowledge will save you in prod.

⥽ Docker & Kubernetes
> Knowing how to build, ship, and scale with Docker and K8s will make you valuable even if you’re using Copilot for code.

⥽ Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS, etc.)
> When you need to decouple services or handle unpredictable spikes, nothing beats message queues. AI will not explain why your system dropped messages at 3AM, but you’ll know if you actually practiced queues.

⥽ ElasticSearch
> Search is not just about matching keywords. If you ever need to build search, logs, or analytics at scale, Elastic will come up.

⥽ WebSockets
> For anything real-time, chat, games, live dashboards, WebSockets are key. Your AI tools won’t design a fault-tolerant, low-latency messaging layer for you. Only learning, building, and breaking things will.

⥽ Distributed Tracing
> In a microservices jungle, tracing lets you see exactly where requests slow down or fail. AI will tell you “add tracing,” but you have to know where and how to trace.

⥽ Logging & Monitoring
> Nobody wants to get a “site down” call at midnight with zero logs. Learn what, when, and how to log. Monitoring will help you detect issues before users even see them.

⥽ Concurrency & Race Conditions
> Even the best AI misses subtle concurrency bugs. Learn how to write and review multithreaded or async code. You’ll save days in debugging.

⥽ Load Balancers & Circuit Breakers
> When your backend goes down or traffic spikes, these patterns keep your service up. Theory is easy, handling real-world outages is something you have to experience.

⥽ API Gateways & Rate Limiting
> If you ever ship a public API, you’ll thank yourself for knowing this. Otherwise, get ready for abuse, cost overruns, or worse.

⥽ SQL vs NoSQL
> Not every problem is a nail, not every DB is a hammer. Know when to pick each.

⥽ CAP Theorem & Consistency Models
> Distributed systems fail in surprising ways. CAP and consistency are what separate coders from engineers.

⥽ CDN & Edge Computing
> Speed isn’t just about code. If your users are global, your infra better be too.

⥽ Security Basics
> Learn OAuth, JWTs, and encryption because you don’t want to be the engineer who lets a breach happen.

⥽ CI/CD & Git
> Automated tests, clean deployments, and rollback plans.
AI can’t fix a botched deploy for you.

Write some scripts, push your local hardware, break things, and figure out why. This is how you build instincts that AI can’t teach.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajya-vardhan/,"95% of people think the highest-paid software engineers spend most of their time writing code.

But if you watch them, you’ll notice something else.

Here’s what top engineers actually do a lot:
→ Read code and documents (more than they write)
→ Talk to other engineers and teams, asking questions, clarifying, and sharing context
→ Listen deeply, sometimes for long stretches, just to really understand
→ Spend hours thinking, mapping ideas, sketching on whiteboards, erasing, and starting over

I’ve been working as an Engineering Manager at Google for the last 4 years, and I’ve seen this play out over and over:

There are days when an engineer’s whole morning will be just them thinking, a whiteboard, and a tough problem that needs to be solved.

And when standup comes the next day, they will say:
“I spent most of yesterday thinking through that tough issue we’re facing.”

The best engineers do what helps the business most. Sometimes that’s code.

But often, it’s thinking through problems,
connecting dots, or giving clarity to the team.

It might not look productive from the outside.
But that’s how big problems actually get solved.

ChatGPT can do it. 
Anyone can be a software engineer now…

➥Product: “Just build this new feature, it should be simple.”
↪︎Engineering: “Simple means understanding legacy code, integrations, and five edge cases.”

➥Design: “Here’s the perfect user flow.”
↪︎Engineering: “Now let’s make it work on every device, with every backend quirk, and under real-world load.”

➥QA: “Found a new issue on the latest build.”

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rajya-vardhan/,"On average, a Senior Software Engineer earns 3-5x more than a Junior Engineer, not just because they have more years of experience but because they bring more value to the table.

Now, imagine two engineers in a company:

🔹 Engineer A (The Hard Worker)

— Works 10 hours a day, fixing bugs and writing thousands of lines of code.
— Takes tasks as they come, without questioning their impact.
— Feels stuck in the cycle of ""doing more but growing less.""

🔹 Engineer B (The Impact Player)

— Spends time understanding the real business problem
+ before writing a single line of code.

— Identifies a critical bottleneck in the system and
+ writes a 500-line script that saves the company ₹5-7 lakh/year.

— Proactively optimizes existing workflows, making the system faster,
+ more scalable, and easier to maintain.

Now, when promotion time comes, who do you think the company values more?

► Being busy ≠ being valuable.
► Your output = the impact you create.

○ How to Work in the Right Direction?

✅ Solve problems, not just complete tasks
→ Before jumping into code, ask: Why does this matter?
→ Work on bottlenecks, optimizations, and automations that create lasting value.

✅ Think beyond ""just coding""
→ A Senior Engineer is half problem-solver, half strategist.
→ They design systems, reduce complexity, and make better decisions, not just churn out code.

✅ Understand how your work affects the business
→ A 200-line script that saves money is worth more than a 10,000-line feature no one uses.
→ The best engineers don’t just write code, they improve systems, products, and efficiency.

Less than 1% know how it actually works.


Here’s the simplest breakdown you'll find:

📌 The Model
↳ Imagine a giant factory. Raw data goes in, it gets processed step by step, and out comes something useful.

📌 Input & Output
↳ To a model, everything is numbers. Your words are turned into math → processed → then turned back into sentences.

📌 How It Learns
↳ At first, the model guesses. It checks how wrong it was, adjusts, and tries again. Do this millions of times, and it gets really good.

📌 Understanding Words
↳ Words aren’t stored as text, but as “coordinates” in a space. That’s why “king” and “queen” sit close together. The model learns meaning, not just spelling.

📌 Generative AI
↳ Instead of choosing a label, it writes. One word at a time, predicting the most likely next word (like an autocomplete, but far more powerful).

That’s why ChatGPT feels like it “understands” you... when really, it’s math, patterns, and a lot of training!

This graphic explains it beautifully. Great for beginners, and even better when you need to explain AI to others.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-beggiato/,"Harsh truth after building 50+ AI Agents: 
If AI saves time but doesn’t help you make money, it’s not a tool, it’s a toy.

Many people start building AI thinking that automation means efficiency.

They focus on speeding up what they're already doing:

- Sending emails faster.
- Moving data.
- Sorting files.

And it feels like progress... and in a way it is.
Things are happening quicker.

But nothing fundamental changes.

Leads don’t close faster.
Revenue doesn’t increase.
Operations don’t run without someone watching.

That’s what most people get wrong,
And here’s what usually happens:

They automate steps, not systems.
They remove clicks, not decisions.
They create speed, not outcomes.

Instead of asking:
“how do I automate this task?”

They should ask:
“how do I remove myself from this process while still getting the result?”

Here’s the difference:

✅ Automating a task is:
↳ Writing a draft email for follow-up.

✅ Automating an outcome means:
↳ Detecting cold leads
↳ Rewriting the message based on context
↳ Sending it
↳ Logging it
↳ Booking the call

All without human intervention.

One reduces time.
The other removes work.

If someone is learning to build AI agents, they should stop focusing on the obvious steps and start thinking in systems:

- What triggers the action?
- Who or what decides what to do next?
- What is the goal this should achieve without me?

The more of that you define,the closer you get to building something that’s actually useful, not just fast.

If you step away for 3 days and nothing happens, you built a time-saver.

If you step away and results keep happening, you built a system that works.

Big difference.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanni-beggiato/,"Amazon’s writing culture is legendary.

Here are 5 lessons anyone can apply:

Writing isn’t about sounding smarter.

It’s about thinking more clearly.

It powers decisions, strategy, and execution.

At Amazon, every doc is a test:
→ Can you explain this in simple words?
→ Can you back it with data, not fluff?
→ Can you quickly get to the point?

Because if the writing is unclear, the thinking probably is too.

And most writing is unclear.

We confuse complexity with intelligence.
We write to impress, not to be understood.
We bury insight under jargon.

But Amazon raised the bar.

They turned writing into a leadership skill.
A thinking tool.
A company-wide discipline.

And once you’ve written the Amazon way, it’s hard to go back.

Here are 5 principles anyone can apply
(no matter where you work):

⸻

🔸 1. Use fewer words

Writing clearly isn’t about shrinking your message; it’s about sharpening it.

At Amazon, the rule is simple:
→ Sentences under 30 words
→ One idea per sentence
→ No filler, no fluff

If it doesn’t drive the point forward, it doesn’t belong.

✅ Instead of:
“We are currently in the process of evaluating options.”
👉 Say:
“We’re evaluating options.”

Clarity cuts the noise.

⸻

🔸 2. Replace adjectives with data

“Impressive.” “Great.” “High-performing.”
None of these belong in your doc.

Amazon doesn’t guess impact, they measure it.

✅ Instead of:
“Our launch went really well.”
👉 Say:
“Adoption hit 82% in the first 48 hours.”

Numbers don’t just inform. They persuade.

⸻

🔸 3. Eliminate weasel words

“Might.” “Could.” “Some say.”
These are warning signs of weak thinking.

Amazon writing demands ownership.
Say what you mean and own the consequences.

✅ Instead of:
“It might be helpful to consider…”
👉 Say:
“We recommend this based on [data/insight].”

Confidence isn’t about being loud.
It’s about being clear.

⸻

🔸 4. Ask: ‘So what?’

Information isn’t value.
Context is.

Amazon pushes every writer to answer:
Why does this matter?

✅ Instead of:
“Engagement improved this quarter.”
👉 Say:
“Engagement rose 14%, helping reduce churn by 9%.”

If a sentence doesn’t earn its space, it gets cut.

⸻

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"New Course: Post-training of LLMs

Learn to post-train and customize an LLM in this short course, taught by, Assistant Professor at the, and co-founder of.

Training an LLM to follow instructions or answer questions has two key stages: pre-training and post-training. In pre-training, it learns to predict the next word or token from large amounts of unlabeled text. In post-training, it learns useful behaviors such as following instructions, tool use, and reasoning.

Post-training transforms a general-purpose token predictor—trained on trillions of unlabeled text tokens—into an assistant that follows instructions and performs specific tasks. Because it is much cheaper than pre-training, it is practical for many more teams to incorporate post-training methods into their workflows than pre-training.

In this course, you’ll learn three common post-training methods—Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Online Reinforcement Learning (RL)—and how to use each one effectively. With SFT, you train the model on pairs of input and ideal output responses. With DPO, you provide both a preferred (chosen) and a less preferred (rejected) response and train the model to favor the preferred output. With RL, the model generates an output, receives a reward score based on human or automated feedback, and updates the model to improve performance.

You’ll learn the basic concepts, common use cases, and principles for curating high-quality data for effective training. Through hands-on labs, you’ll download a pre-trained model from Hugging Face and post-train it using SFT, DPO, and RL to see how each technique shapes model behavior.

In detail, you’ll:
- Understand what post-training is, when to use it, and how it differs from pre-training.
- Build an SFT pipeline to turn a base model into an instruct model.
- Explore how DPO reshapes behavior by minimizing contrastive loss—penalizing poor responses and reinforcing preferred ones.
- Implement a DPO pipeline to change the identity of a chat assistant.
- Learn online RL methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and how to design reward functions.
- Train a model with GRPO to improve its math capabilities using a verifiable reward.

Post-training is one of the most rapidly developing areas of LLM training. Whether you’re building a high-accuracy context-specific assistant, fine-tuning a model's tone, or improving task-specific accuracy, this course will give you experience with the most important techniques shaping how LLMs are post-trained today.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"I’d like to share a tip for getting more practice building with AI — that is, either using AI building blocks to build applications or using AI coding assistance to create powerful applications quickly: If you find yourself with only limited time to build, reduce the scope of your project until you can build something in whatever time you do have.

If you have only an hour, find a small component of an idea that you're excited about that you can build in an hour. With modern coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude Code (my favorite dev tool right now), you might be surprised at how much you can do even in short periods of time! This gets you going, and you can always continue the project later.

To become good at building with AI, most people must (i) learn relevant techniques, for example by taking online AI courses, and (ii) practice building. I know developers who noodle on ideas for months without actually building anything — I’ve done this too! — because we feel we don’t have time to get started. If you find yourself in this position, I encourage you to keep cutting the initial project scope until you identify a small component you can build right away.

Let me illustrate with an example — one of my many small, fun weekend projects that might never go anywhere, but that I’m glad I did.

Here’s the idea: Many people fear public speaking. And public speaking is challenging to practice, because it's hard to organize an audience. So I thought it would be interesting to build an audience simulator to provide a digital audience of dozens to hundreds of virtual people on a computer monitor and let a user practice by speaking to them.

One Saturday afternoon, I found myself in a coffee shop with a couple of hours to spare and decided to give the audience simulator a shot. My familiarity with graphics coding is limited, so instead of building a complex simulator of a large audience and writing AI software to simulate appropriate audience responses, I decided to cut scope significantly to (a) simulating an audience of one person (which I could replicate later to simulate N persons), (b) omitting AI and letting a human operator manually select the reaction of the simulated audience (similar to Wizard of Oz prototyping), and (c) implementing the graphics using a simple 2D avatar.

Using a mix of several coding assistants, I built a basic version in the time I had. The avatar could move subtly and blink, but otherwise it used basic graphics. Even though it fell far short of a sophisticated audience simulator, I am glad I built this. In addition to moving the project forward and letting me explore different designs, it advanced my knowledge of basic graphics. Further, having this crude prototype to show friends helped me get user feedback that shaped my views on the product idea.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"On Monday, a United States District Court ruled that training LLMs on copyrighted books constitutes fair use. A number of authors had filed suit against Anthropic for training its models on their books without permission. Just as we allow people to read books and learn from them to become better writers, but not to regurgitate copyrighted text verbatim, the judge concluded that it is fair use for AI models to do so as well.

Indeed, Judge Alsup wrote that the authors’ lawsuit is “no different than it would be if they complained that training schoolchildren to write well would result in an explosion of competing works.” While it remains to be seen whether the decision will be appealed, this ruling is reasonable and will be good for AI progress. (Usual caveat: I am not a lawyer and am not giving legal advice.)

AI has massive momentum, but a few things could put progress at risk:
- Regulatory capture that stifles innovation, including especially open source
- Loss of access to cutting-edge semiconductor chips (the most likely cause would be war breaking out in Taiwan)
- Regulations that severely impede access to data for training AI systems

Access to high-quality data is important. Even though the mass media tends to talk about the importance of building large data centers and scaling up models, when I speak with friends at companies that train foundation models, many describe a very large amount of their daily challenges as data preparation. Specifically, a significant fraction of their day-to-day work follows the usual Data Centric AI practices of identifying high-quality data (books are one important source), cleaning data (the ruling describes Anthropic taking steps like removing book pages' headers, footers, and page numbers), carrying out error analyses to figure out what types of data to acquire more of, and inventing new ways to generate synthetic data.

I am glad that a major risk to data access just decreased. Appropriately, the ruling further said that Anthropic’s conversion of books from paper format to digital — a step that’s needed to enable training — also was fair use. However, in a loss for Anthropic, the judge indicated that, while training on data that was acquired legitimately is fine, using pirated materials (such as texts downloaded from pirate websites) is not fair use. Thus, Anthropic still may be liable on this point. Other LLM providers, too, will now likely have to revisit their practices if they use datasets that may contain pirated works.

Overall, the ruling is positive for AI progress. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that it reduces ambiguity with respect to AI training and copyright and (if it stands up to appeals) makes the roadmap for compliance clearer....

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"I hope we can empower everyone to build with AI. Starting from K-12, we should teach every student AI enabled coding, since this will enable them to become more productive and more empowered adults. But there is a huge shortage of computer science (CS) teachers. I recently spoke with high school basketball coach Kyle Creasy, who graduated with a B.A. in Physical Education in 2023. Until two years ago, he had never written a line of Python. Now — with help from AI — he not only writes code, he also teaches CS. I found Kyle’s story inspiring as a model for scaling up CS education in the primary- and secondary-school levels.

Kyle’s success has been with the support of Kira Learning (an AI Fund portfolio company), whose founders Andrea Pasinetti and Jagriti Agrawal have created a compelling vision for CS education. In K-12 classrooms, teachers play a huge social-emotional support role, for example, encouraging students and helping them when they stumble. In addition, they are expected to be subject-matter experts who can deliver the content needed for their subject. Kira Learning uses digital content delivery — educational videos, autograded quizzes, and AI-enabled chatbots to answer students' questions but without giving away homework answers — so the teacher can focus on social-emotional support. While these are still early days, it appears to be working!

A key to making this possible is the hyperpersonalization that is now possible with AI (in contrast to the older idea of the flipped classroom, which had limited adoption). For example, when assigned a problem in an online coding environment, if a student writes this buggy line of Python code

best_$alty_snack = 'potato chips'

Kira Learning’s AI system can spot the problem and directly tell the teacher that $ is an invalid character in a variable name. It can also suggest a specific question for the teacher to ask the student to help get them unstuck, like “Can you identify what characters are allowed in variable names?” Whereas AI can directly deliver personalized advice to students, the fact that it is now helping teachers also deliver personalized support will really help in K-12.

Additionally, agentic workflows can automate a lot of teachers’ repetitive tasks. For example, when designing a curriculum, it’s time-consuming to align the content to educational standards (such as the Common Core in the United States, or the AP CS standard for many CS classes). Having an AI system carry out tasks like these is already proving helpful for teachers.

Since learning to code, Kyle has built many pieces of software. He proudly showed me an analysis he generated in matplotlib of his basketball players’ attempts to shoot three-pointers (shown above), which in turn is affecting the team’s strategy on the court. One lesson is clear: When a basketball coach learns to code, they become a better basketball coach!

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"Even though I’m a much better Python than JavaScript developer, with AI assistance, I’ve been writing a lot of JavaScript code recently. AI-assisted coding, including vibe coding, is making specific programming languages less important, even though learning one is still helpful to make sure you understand the key concepts. This is helping many developers write code in languages we’re not familiar with, which lets us get code working in many more contexts!

My background is in machine learning engineering and back-end development, but AI-assisted coding is making it easy for me to build front-end systems (the part of a website or app that users interact with) using JavaScript (JS) or TypeScript (TS), languages that I am weak in. Generative AI is making syntax less important, so we can all simultaneously be Python, JS, TS, C++, Java, and even Cobol developers. Perhaps one day, instead of being “Python developers"" or “C++ developers,” many more of us will just be “developers”!

But understanding the concepts behind different languages is still important. That’s why learning at least one language like Python still offers a great foundation for prompting LLMs to generate code in Python and other languages. If you move from one programming language to another that carries out similar tasks but with different syntax — say, from JS to TS, or C++ to Java, or Rust to Go — once you’ve learned the first set of concepts, you’ll know a lot of the concepts needed to prompt an LLM to code in the second language. (Although TensorFlow and PyTorch are not programming languages, learning the concepts of deep learning behind TensorFlow will also make it much easier to get an LLM to write PyTorch code for you, and vice versa!) In addition, you’ll be able to understand much of the generated code (perhaps with a little LLM assistance).

Different programming languages reflect different views of how to organize computation, and understanding the concepts is still important. For example, someone who does not understand arrays, dictionaries, caches, and memory will be less effective at getting an LLM to write code in most languages.

Similarly, a Python developer who moves toward doing more front-end programming with JS would benefit from learning the concepts behind front-end systems. For example, if you want an LLM to build a front end using the React framework, it will benefit you to understand how React breaks front ends into reusable UI components, and how it updates the DOM data structure that determines what web pages look like. This lets you prompt the LLM much more precisely, and helps you understand how to fix issues if something goes wrong. Similarly, if you want an LLM to help you write code in CUDA or ROCm, it helps to understand how GPUs organize compute and memory.

Learn how to build code agents in this course, created in collaboration with, and taught by, its co-founder and CSO, and, Hugging Face’s Project Lead on Agents.

Tool-calling agents use LLMs to generate multiple function calls sequentially to complete a complex sequence of tasks. They generate one function call, execute it, observe, reason, and decide what to do next. Code agents take a different approach. They consolidate all these calls into a single block of code, letting the LLM lay out an entire action plan at once, which can be executed efficiently to provide more reliable results.

You’ll learn how to code agents using smolagents, a lightweight agentic framework from Hugging Face. Along the way, you’ll learn how to run LLM-generated code safely and develop an evaluation system to optimize your code agent for production.

In detail, you’ll learn:

- How code agents write their actions in code.
- When code agents outperform function-calling agents.
- How to run code agents safely in your system using a constrained Python interpreter and sandboxing using E2B.
- To trace, debug, and assess the code agent to optimize its behaviours for complex requests.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"I’ve noticed that many GenAI application projects put in automated evaluations (evals) of the system’s output probably later — and rely on humans to manually examine and judge outputs longer — than they should. This is because building evals is viewed as a massive investment (say, creating 100 or 1,000 examples, and designing and validating metrics) and there’s never a convenient moment to put in that up-front cost. Instead, I encourage teams to think of building evals as an iterative process. It’s okay to start with a quick-and-dirty implementation (say, 5 examples with unoptimized metrics) and then iterate and improve over time. This allows you to gradually shift the burden of evaluations away from humans and toward automated evals.

I wrote previously in The Batch about the importance and difficulty of creating evals. Say you’re building a customer-service chatbot that responds to users in free text. There’s no single right answer, so many teams end up having humans pore over dozens of example outputs with every update to judge if it improved the system. While techniques like LLM-as-judge are helpful, the details of getting this to work well (such as what prompt to use, what context to give the judge, and so on) are finicky to get right. All this contributes to the impression that building evals requires a large up-front investment, and thus on any given day, a team can make more progress by relying on human judges than figuring out how to build automated evals.

I encourage you to approach building evals differently. It’s okay to build quick evals that are only partial, incomplete, and noisy measures of the system’s performance, and to iteratively improve them. They can be a complement to, rather than replacement for, manual evaluations. Over time, you can gradually tune the evaluation methodology to close the gap between the evals’ output and human judgments. For example:
- It’s okay to start with very few examples in the eval set, say 5, and gradually add to them over time — or subtract them if you find that some examples are too easy or too hard, and not useful for distinguishing between the performance of different versions of your system.
- It’s okay to start with evals that measure only a subset of the dimensions of performance you care about, or measure narrow cues that you believe are correlated with, but don’t fully capture, system performance. For example if, at a certain moment in the conversation, your customer-support agent is supposed to (i) call an API to issue a refund and (ii) generate an appropriate message to the user, you might start off measuring only whether or not it calls the API correctly and not worry about the message. Or if, at a certain moment, your chatbot should recommend a specific product, a basic eval could measure whether or not the chatbot mentions that product without worrying about what it says about it.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewyng,"At the Artificial Intelligence Action Summit in Paris this week, U.S. Vice President J.D. Vance said, “I’m not here to talk about AI safety.... I’m here to talk about AI opportunity.” I’m thrilled to see the U.S. government focus on opportunities in AI. Further, while it is important to use AI responsibly and try to stamp out harmful applications, I feel “AI safety” is not the right terminology for addressing this important problem. Language shapes thought, so using the right words is important. I’d rather talk about “responsible AI” than “AI safety.” Let me explain.

First, there are clearly harmful applications of AI, such as non-consensual deepfake porn (which creates sexually explicit images of real people without their consent), the use of AI in misinformation, potentially unsafe medical diagnoses, addictive applications, and so on. We definitely want to stamp these out! There are many ways to apply AI in harmful or irresponsible ways, and we should discourage and prevent such uses.

However, the concept of “AI safety” tries to make AI — as a technology — safe, rather than making safe applications of it. Consider the similar, obviously flawed notion of “laptop safety.” There are great ways to use a laptop and many irresponsible ways, but I don’t consider laptops to be intrinsically either safe or unsafe. It is the application, or usage, that determines if a laptop is safe. Similarly, AI, a general-purpose technology with numerous applications, is neither safe nor unsafe. How someone chooses to use it determines whether it is harmful or beneficial.

Now, safety isn’t always a function only of how something is used. An unsafe airplane is one that, even in the hands of an attentive and skilled pilot, has a large chance of mishap. So we definitely should strive to build safe airplanes (and make sure they are operated responsibly)! The risk factors are associated with the construction of the aircraft rather than merely its application. Similarly, we want safe automobiles, blenders, dialysis machines, food, buildings, power plants, and much more.

“AI safety” presupposes that AI, the underlying technology, can be unsafe. I find it more useful to think about how applications of AI can be unsafe. Further, “responsible AI” emphasizes that it is our responsibility to avoid building applications that are unsafe or harmful and to discourage people from using even beneficial products in harmful ways.

I believe the 2023 Bletchley AI Safety Summit slowed down European AI development — without making anyone safer — by wasting time considering science-fiction AI fears. Last month, at Davos, business and policy leaders also had strong concerns about whether Europe can dig itself out of the current regulatory morass and focus on building with AI. I am hopeful that the Paris meeting, unlike the one at Bletchley, will result in acceleration rather than deceleration.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuckkeith/,"What’s the difference between these two DNS lookups?

They look similar, but they tell very different stories.

In the first command:

⌨️ nslookup

You're asking your default DNS resolver (router or ISP).
✅ Recursive lookup, following all CNAMEs to the final IPs.
❌ Non-authoritative = cached and possibly outdated.

In the second command:

⌨️ nslookup

You’re directly asking the authoritative DNS server.
✅ The answer comes straight from the source
❌ Only tells you what that server knows (stops at 1st CNAME)

So which is better? It depends on your goal.

💨 Use your default resolver if you want the final IP quickly.
🔎 Use the authoritative if you want to verify who controls what.",Chuck Keith

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chuckkeith/,"Why wait for schools to give your kids Claude’s learning mode when you can build it yourself!?

Here’s how to do it using prompts, open source tools, and a VPS👇

1️⃣ Use Open WebUI to host your own ChatGPT or Claude

Install Open WebUI on a VPS. It mimics the look and feel of Claude or ChatGPT, but gives you total control. This interface lets you set your own models, prompts, and restrict access for safer learning.

2️⃣ Host it on a cloud VPS using Hostinger

I like to use Hostinger to spin up a server that runs the WebUI as it's affordable and powerful enough to run your own learning assistant in the cloud.

3️⃣ Configure model settings with custom system prompts

In the admin panel, go to:
Settings → Models → Claude/ChatGPT.

Add a structured system prompt like Ethan Mollick’s “Tutor Prompt"":.

His prompt starts by assessing the student’s level, asking what they know. Then, it guides the student with tailored examples, Socratic questions, and refuses to give away answers.

It mirrors how Claude’s learning mode functions.

4️⃣ Restrict access to only educational AI models

To keep things safe for kids or students, only expose the tutoring models, not the full AI interface. This prevents misuse and ensures focus stays on learning.

5️⃣ You can switch between Claude and ChatGPT

Depending on API access, you can let your local WebUI use Claude, ChatGPT, or any LLM you want. It’s versatile and gives you flexibility for experimenting with different models.",Chuck Keith

Update: we have a blog on this https://lnkd.in/gcrD5uxn

👀 What is happening 👀
has observed a number of threat actors gain access into internal networks via Sonicwall devices.

This is happening at a pace that suggests exploitation, possibly a zero day exploit in Sonicwall. Threat actors have gained control of accounts that even have MFA deployed.

Threat actors are pivoting from the Sonicwall device straight to the DC. Their post-compromise activities range from ransomware (akira, we suspect) to creating additional users for persistence.

⁉️ What should I do / what does Huntress advise⁉️

We first advise that the Sonicwall VPN services are disabled, until a patch or communication from Sonicwall materialises.

If the Sonicwall VPN must be kept online, restrict VPN access to a number of trusted IPs, and segment the network to limit pivot opportunities

Contact Sonicwall support for more information and guidance, as so far there have not been any comms from Sonicwall

If you're a current Huntress partner, ensure you've deployed Huntress SIEM and are exporting your Sonicwall logs, to allow us additional security visibility, and please make sure our EDR is installed on all machines .

If you're not yet a Huntress partner, leverage our trial for monitoring (if you want, disable the trial after when this Sonicwall situ is done, I'm not after your money 🙏 )

It also raises the bar on note quality. Vague lines get rewritten or tagged “TOO GENERIC →”. Missing details are called out with [MISSING: …]. Key numbers and deliverables are bolded.

Anthropic officially released Claude Opus 4.1 - an upgrade to Opus 4 with a major coding and reasoning boost (scoring 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified). It’s now better at multi-file refactoring and pinpointing bug fixes without introducing unnecessary changes. Still a bit expensive, so only use it when you really need it.

⚡ Memory Boost
can now reference past chats (I’ve been screaming for this!!) so there’s no more re-explaining your project every session. You can ask it, “What was I working on last week?” and Claude will tell you about the marketing plan you abandoned and the vet appointment you forgot to put in your calendar.

⚡ Claude Sonnet 4 → 1M token context window
That’s ~75K lines of code or dozens of research papers in one go. You can load your entire codebase and API docs, company knowledge base, or multi-year strategy documents without losing context. Now in public beta through API and Amazon Bedrock (with Google Cloud coming soon)

⚡ Claude for Government is $1 for all three branches
Anthropic made its enterprise and FedRAMP High models accessible to U.S. federal, legislative, and judiciary branches for a dollar (OpenAI has done the same). Already live in DoD, DC Health, and Lawrence Livermore National Lab.

I’m thrilled that the AI-First Conference is sponsored by Claude, and you can join me, the Head of Claude, an expert on the Claude Applied AI team, and 9 other unbelievable guest speakers to learn the real steps to turn your work into an AI-first business and how to prepare for the future.

I can think of thousands of ways to use AI and they tend to fall into three categories.

⚡️ Do stuff faster - AI handles tedious tasks you’d normally spend minutes or days on. Like pulling action items from meetings, summarizing reports, generating first drafts. Same output, fraction of the time. Most people stop here (boo!).

🎯 Do stuff better - Take your existing work to the next level. Instead of basic research, get personalized insights. Instead of simple sales forecasts, analyze 10x more data sources for higher accuracy. Instead of hoping your proposal lands, test it against 30 synthetic personas first. Instead of brainstorming alone in your shower, debate with AI for 20 minutes and get 300 new ideas. There are plenty of ways I use AI that DO NOT SAVE TIME. That is encouraged on my team if it makes our work better.

🔮 Do new stuff - Unlock capabilities you never had before. Non-engineers building apps. Financial analysts creating multimedia presentations like the UBS AI avatars with Synthesia. Teachers personalizing curriculum for every student. Grandparents organizing decades of photos in minutes.

And here's a crazy new stat: 2.26% of all Claude conversations are for emotional support and life coaching. People are actively searching for more meaning, more value, more depth.

And YET, the majority of AI demos I see on the internet fall into category 1. And those folks find themselves on a never ending hamster wheel of productivity. Just trying to run faster and faster. Only to realize they should stop running and buy rollerblades. Or a hoverboard.

Close friendships and romantic relationships are one of the most amazing things about being alive. Humans find each other, and stick by each other, some for life through thick and thin.

For me, the only way to do relationships is being ride-or-die for each other. Same applies to close friendships.

I'm going through some heartbreak at the moment (that's life), and wondering how it all turned out this way. Getting laid has always been easy. Finding a woman to spend the rest of my life with has not been.

The great thing about life though is that every new day is full of possibilities.

I think the main issue has been that I'm an introvert who loves being at home, reading/working/chilling alone or with close friends. But this year I'm doing a bit of the opposite: taking on some wild adventures. In that spirit, I'm traveling to some very beautiful (and in some cases dangerous) places.

About 5 years ago, I started sharing my learnings from the ground on social media to help anyone else grappling with problems we had already faced and navigated

In this period, the number of people following my content increased manyfold. I also started getting many requests to document my learnings in a more structured and detailed form in a book. Zero To Scale is the result of it

And it took a good 2 years and many writing sessions on Sunday evenings ( that is the only time I had) to bring it to life

In this book, I’ve covered everything that I possibly could to help anyone build and grow their brand in India. Everything I’ve written is what we ourselves followed at Atomberg for growing our fan business, and now following them again to build our new categories like mixer grinders and water purifiers from scratch

Grateful to everyone who took the pain to go through the early drafts and share their feedback/praise, some of which are published here

The book is about 40000 words long and I have tried my best to strike the right balance between depth and brevity in each topic. The table of content is also here

I genuinely wish to help Indian entrepreneurs and operators grow faster and better. Even the choice of publisher, Wyzr, is reflective of that. I met the founder, Yashraj, my junior from college and was impressed by the work they had already done and their drive to make an impact in an industry that’s in need of some energy

Building distribution, generating demand and building a brand isn’t easy. Even if ever so slightly, I hope this book helps you in that journey

Passion is overrated. Seriously.

I love singing - but if I ever auditioned for Indian Idol, I’m pretty sure the judges would've hit eject before I hit the chorus 😅

That’s the trap.

We've been sold this romantic lie:
“Follow your passion, and the money will follow.”

👉 Follow what you’re oddly good at
👉 Master it like your life depends on it

It’s called the DINK lifestyle, Double Income, No Kids.

And it’s not just a Western idea anymore. It’s growing in India at over 30% every year.

In some states, 65% of newlyweds say they want to delay or skip having children.

And interestingly, rural India is leading this shift. 42% of rural two-member households fall into this category, almost double that of urban India.

Because today’s couples are prioritising:
→ Financial independence
→ Emotional readiness
→ Travel, passion projects, and personal growth

→ More demand for premium experiences, not family bundles
→ A rise in solo living, pet care, mental wellness, and elder support

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupammittal007/,"“India doesn’t have tech companies.” - That was the headline.

Here’s what I actually said 👇

Most companies in India are tech-enabled.

Not many are pure tech.

Yet, every company and industry is now positioned as xTech. Except they are not.

As an employee or investor it’s important to understand that it's the characteristics of a company that determine the nature of the company.

Here is the difference -

Real tech =

– Software or digital goods → close to zero marginal cost of replication
– High Gross Margins → minimal COGS
– Network effects & scale with minimal capital → near permanent moats
– Proprietary IP or Infra → too capital intensive to beat
Social Media, AI, Search, SaaS, Matchmaking, Gaming play here.

Think,,,,,

Tech-enabled =

– Real goods → lower gross margins
– Require ops, logistics, supply chains, people → tougher to scale
– High competitive intensity → margins can erode over time

D2C brands, product & service marketplaces, proptech, logistics, even most edtech players fall here.

They use tech, but tech isn’t the product. Think Cars24, Unacademy, Wakefit, Swiggy.

So, why the confusion? Bcz the multiples are better 🤷🏼

Not surprisingly, an ad in TOI attempted to position a real-estate developer as a ‘leading consumer tech company’. That's NOT tech, that's cosplay.

Truth is, depending on growth & margins, tech trades at 5-20X revenue while tech-enabled at 2-5X, in most cases.

The one-metric test is that if the company can’t hit 30%+ op margin at scale, it is probably not building tech, but with it.

While both are valuable for India, the reality is that if we wish to build global cos from India, fast, the only way is to have more founders index towards pure-tech companies rather than focus on tech-washing 😅

Good news is that I see this already happening, especially with AI 🇮🇳

I get this question often.

And while there’s no single formula, I’ve come to believe it boils down to just two superpowers:

1️⃣ The Ability to Sell

Not just products.
But your vision, your dream, your crazy ideas.

You’ll need to convince people to join you,
Convince investors to fund you 💰
Convince customers to try you
…and sometimes, convince yourself to keep going 😅

If you can’t sell, it’s going to be a long and lonely ride.
So get out there — pitch, persuade, hustle, repeat.
Sales isn’t sleazy. It’s survival.

2️⃣ The Ability to Build

This doesn’t just mean writing code.
It means being obsessed with solving a problem.
It means focusing on one thing for a long time
…while everyone around you thinks you’ve lost it.

It’s being okay with being misunderstood.
And staying the course — even when nothing makes sense.

You master these two?
You become unbeatable 💥

And, this isn’t just about being a founder 👉

🎓 Students - these are life skills, not job titles.
👨‍💼 Professionals - being able to sell and build can unlock every door, whether you’re in a startup, a corporate job, or building your own side hustle.

I have learned that there is no “right time.”
You start Learning. You Start Selling. You Start Building.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anupammittal007/,"54% of Indians believe financial responsibility should be shared between partners. 

This challenges the decade old belief which was the foundation of our society:

👨‍💼 Men provided.
👩‍🍳 Women supported.

Not because they always wanted to, but because that’s how it was designed.

A man’s worth was his paycheck & a woman’s worth was how well she supported his success.

But today, the equation is shifting.

✔️ Saudi Arabia – Female workforce participation has doubled in just seven years.

✔️ Japan – The traditional salaryman culture is giving way to dual-income households.

✔️ India – More couples are choosing financial partnership over financial dependency.

And for the first time, men are questioning whether work alone should define their worth.

Plus, businesses today aren’t built by men alone anymore.

They’re built by co-founders, couples, and true financial equals.

From Nykaa’s Falguni & Sanjay Nayar to Zivame’s Richa Kar & Kartikeya Sharma, the new model of success is much about shared financial responsibility!

Candidates say: “I’m looking for the right culture.”
Founders say: “We’re building a strong culture.”

We point to values. Mission statements. Purpose posters. Heck, even Enron and Theranos had those.

I’m sure Byju’s did too. (Changing the world, revolutionizing learning, etc.)

So why did they implode so spectacularly?

I've wrestled with this for years. And here’s the best I could come up with >

👉 Culture = Operating Model × People Strategy

Why that formula?

Because if either one is zero, you’ve got…well, 0 culture.

✅ Great people + broken systems = chaos.
✅ Great systems + wrong people = gridlock.

Only when both click, does magic happen.

So what’s a good Operating Model (esp. for early/growth stage startups)?

🤔 How is it that kids can still access far worse content with zero guardrails?

(YT is the worst of all offenders.  For eg, although I have parental controls set up for my 7 yr old, I am shocked at the age-inappropriate content that YT keeps serving up)

I personally think Ranveer, Apoorva, Samay et all are actually victims caught in an endless cycle of provocation for their relevance & survival.

14 rounds of negotiations
5 different PMs. 


It finally happened — India and the UK signed a free trade agreement.

And here’s what that means for Indian exporters, professionals, and industries:

1. 99% Duty-Free Access
Almost $10 Bn worth of Indian goods will now enter the UK without paying any tariffs — from machinery and chemicals to garments and footwear.

2. Agriculture
More than 95% of Indian Agri and food products (like spices, cereals, pulses, mango pulp, marine products) will now enter duty-free.
Expected growth: 20%+ in just 3 years.

3. Textiles & Apparel
Duty-free access for 1,143 product lines — including carpets, garments, home textiles, and more. Could increase India's market share in the UK by 5% within 1–2 years.

4. Engineering Goods
Tariffs up to 18% will be removed, opening the path for engineering exports to grow from $4.3 Bn → $7.5 Bn by 2029–30.

5. Professionals & Freelancers
Up to 75,000 Indian professionals will be exempt from UK social security payments for 3 years. Indian service providers get access to 36 UK sectors, no Economic Needs Test. Also, 1,800+ Indian chefs, musicians, yoga instructors can work in the UK for 2 years, even without a local employer.

It’ll take about a year for the full rollout. And yes, the benefits look big on paper.

But the real impact?

That depends on how well it’s implemented, how aware Indian exporters are, how fast businesses respond and whether the support systems actually work on the ground.

But What About Finances?

A few years back, a close friend of mine was in what seemed like the perfect relationship.

They had everything going for them—except when it came to their finances. My friend was a meticulous saver, always planning for the future.

Her partner, on the other hand, lived in the moment and spent impulsively.

This financial mismatch led to frequent arguments and significant tension between them.

This story isn’t unique; financial incompatibility affects many relationships and can lead to stress, disagreements, and even breakups.

It’s a red flag that should be addressed early to prevent future heartbreak.

So, how can you navigate financial differences effectively? Here are some strategies that worked for my friend and her partner:

1. Schedule ""money dates"": They set aside one evening each month to discuss their finances over coffee. It might sound mundane, but turning it into a regular, less daunting meeting made a big difference. It became a time to align their goals and celebrate progress.

2. Create a shared vision board: They literally cut out pictures of their dream home, vacation spots, and retirement goals. This visual representation kept them motivated and aligned on their long-term dreams.

3. Use the ""yours, mine, ours"" system: They maintained personal accounts for guilt-free spending and a joint account for shared expenses. This approach removed the stress of constant financial scrutiny and allowed for spontaneous purchases without tension.

4. Respect different money personalities: While my friend was cautious, her partner was a risk-taker. They found a middle ground with a ""fun fund"" for spontaneous buys while keeping their emergency savings intact.

Remember, it’s okay to have different approaches to money. The key is understanding each other's perspectives and finding common ground.

Same product.
Same goal — reach more people with good content.


But the results?
Miles apart.

I worked with two credit card brands last year.
Both were well-known.

But one gave me full freedom, I could write the script, plan the visuals, edit it my way.

The other handed me a fixed script, skit format, brand name right in the first line, no room to move things around (you know the drill).

Results?

→ One reel got 4M views, 50K likes, and strong link clicks.""
→ The other barely touched 200K views, 3K likes, and had almost no clicks.

Difference?
Just one thing: How much trust I was given.

Over time, I’ve realized something especially with branded content. If the content doesn’t offer something to the viewer, they scroll past in seconds.

That’s why whenever I do a branded post, I make sure there’s some value in it.

It could be a simple hack, useful info, or even just a relatable moment (nothing over the top, just helpful).

This does two things:

→ Even if someone doesn’t buy, they still learn something
→ It feels more like a story than an ad, so people actually stay and watch

This approach has worked across campaigns, and it always comes back to one thing: Balance.

Creators understand their audience → their tone, language, what clicks.
Brands know their product.

When both sides come together with trust and flexibility, that’s when content actually works.

So, if you’re a brand or startup trying to grow online —
Think of content not just as a way to sell, but as a way to build trust and attention.

Walk into any beauty store and you’ll see rows of brands —
Affordable. Luxury. Clean. Clinical.

It feels like there’s something for everyone.

But you don’t.

What looks like a wide range of options is actually a carefully designed illusion.

The global beauty industry, worth $677 billion, is largely controlled by just a few companies.

These giants have strategically built massive portfolios — owning multiple brands across every category, price point, and emotional hook.

L’Oréal, for example, owns 39 brands.

On one end, you’ll find Maybelline and Garnier
— affordable and widely available.

On the other, there’s Lancôme, La Roche-Posay, and SkinCeuticals
— for premium skincare lovers.

Estée Lauder owns brands like MAC, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, and La Mer, each positioned for a slightly different customer, yet all under one roof.

Unilever with 38 personal care brands including Dove, Vaseline, Pond’s, and TIGI — covering the mass market through everyday supermarket essentials.

This isn’t just a global trend.

In India’s ₹1.2 lakh crore beauty market, local players are applying the same model.

Honasa Consumer, the parent of MamaEarth, has quietly built a powerful portfolio — with brands like Plum, Dot & Key, The Derma Co., Dr. Sheth’s, and Aqualogica.

Nykaa is doing the same, investing in Earth Rhythm, Nudge Wellness, and launching its own in-house brands across categories.

Each brand is designed to feel unique—

“Clean beauty” for Gen Z, “clinical” for professionals, “premium” for aspirational buyers.

On the surface, it’s variety.
In reality, it’s one company covering every choice you think you have.

Even when customers switch brands, they often stay within the same corporate ecosystem.

The illusion of variety is maintained but the market stays consolidated.

It’s a brilliant strategy from a business lens.

But it does raise a bigger question:

Does this approach give consumers better choices — or does it quietly edge out smaller, independent brands before they even get a chance?",Anushka Rathod

I don’t want them to constantly hustle and grind.
I don’t want them to always agree with me.


But I’ve seen many founders list these as ideal traits.

They’re always looking for people who can work long hours, match their ambition, be as invested as them, and run like the company is their own.

I get the sentiment.
But to be honest? I think these qualities are short-term. They don’t sustain.

Because let’s be real —

No employee can work 10–12 hours every day…
unless they’re rewarded proportionally.

No one stays endlessly ambitious…
unless they’re recognized, heard, and given a reason to care.

Instead of short-term energy, one should look for long-term mindset.

Here’s what I value:
1. Ownership.
People who take accountability, for the wins and the misses. They know what falls under their scope, and they don’t blame-shift when things go south. Whether it’s a crisis or a routine task, they show up with a sense of responsibility.

2. Problem-solving.
One of the most underrated qualities. I deeply value team members who don’t just say “this isn’t working” they try to understand why, think through possible fixes, and then bring it to the table with a future course of action in mind.

3. Bias towards learning.
I admire people who are curious about their craft, take feedback seriously (not personally), and make full use of the courses and resources I sponsor for them.

4. No politics.
Team player > Star performer
People who collaborate instead of competing for credit. The ones who lift others up while growing themselves. In the long run, culture beats brilliance.
These are the qualities that create real outcomes. Not just long hours or endless hustle.

But and this is important, for these qualities to survive, we need to create the right environment too.

One where people don’t fear voicing their opinion.
One where they can ask for help or learning resources without hesitation.

you need to earn ₹2.8 crores.


Why?
TAXES!!

→ ₹70L in income tax
→ ₹12L stamp duty
→ ₹10L GST
→ ₹2L registration

But even after paying all this you still can’t afford a basic house in Mumbai.

And not just Mumbai.

Home prices are soaring across other cities too.

Bangalore home prices went up 23% last year.
Delhi NCR: 31%.
Ahmedabad: 15%.

But how did we get here? How did house prices become so expensive that a middle class can’t afford it?

Simple answer: Demand > Supply.

Across 8 major cities, the demand is 41 lakh homes supply is just 10 lakhs.
But what’s keeping supply so low?

One major reason is poor city planning.

First let's understand what proper planning looks like.

After WW2, Tokyo focused on long-term planning.

Its urban body Tokyo Metropolitan Government runs on a $62 billion budget and handles housing, transport, roads, zoning, and disaster planning.

They follow a clear system:
→ A 30–50-year vision
→ A 5-year Master Plan, regularly updated

Everything is planned together, under one roof.

Now let’s talk about India.
Here planning is all over the place. Urban planning is split between dozens of agencies.

For Ex—
→ In Delhi, one agency builds roads, another controls land use.
→ In Mumbai, MHADA builds homes, but water and roads are handled separately.

On top of this, only 28% of Indian cities have an approved city development plan. [World bank]

Even when plans exist, they’re delayed or ignored.

This leads to weak infrastructure, bad roads, drainage, water issues which means we can’t support tall buildings.

Because of which Mumbai's Floor Space Index (FSI) is just 1.33–2.5, while in cities like Tokyo it can go up to 20.
[FSI = how much construction is allowed on a plot. Higher FSI means more floors]

We build less; land prices stay high.

Worse, much of it was used for illegal colonies that were later legalized for votes—making redevelopment harder.

Result?
→ Over 50% of India’s urban population lives in slums (World Bank).
→ In Mumbai, EMI to Income is 55%

Until we fix that, owning a home will remain out of reach for most families.

I still remember asking this to my mom when I was a kid, just because my dad refused to buy me cream biscuits.

That time I didn’t understand what being frugal meant I just thought we didn’t have money.

Growing up in a Marwari business family, being extremely careful with money was just how life worked. Every rupee mattered, every expense had to be thought through, and saving was always the top priority.

The mindset was “What if there’s no money tomorrow?”

So, we used to track every penny, save what you can, invest wisely, and prepare for the uncertain times because business doesn’t give you monthly salaries, sometimes you earn for 2 years, and then nothing for 5.

Naturally, I inherited that mindset. I was often tagged as ""kanjoos"" and my dad’s copy and honestly, I didn’t even mind it.

He was like that, and so was I.

Even when I started earning myself, I just couldn’t get myself to spend.

It wasn’t about not having enough it was always about the fear of “what if it’s not enough tomorrow?”

That fear of financial distress always lingered in the background and that was my main motivation to earn money.

But over time, as I met more people and saw different perspectives basically jab maine thodi duniya dekhi.

I started to realize that maybe I don’t have to carry that pressure all the time.

Money is still important; I do want to make a lot of it. But the ones who actually build wealth aren’t running after it they just really enjoy what they do, and money follows.

And that made me realize maybe the real goal is to find work that excites you, that doesn’t burn you out, that makes you curious again and when that happens, money will come anyway.",Anushka Rathod

Every time I made a big purchase just for joy — a trip, a gadget, something fancy — there was a voice in my head that said: ""I shouldn’t have done that.""

That frugal mindset takes away the joy of enjoying what you’ve earned.

You’re stuck in between — not fully enjoying the spend, and not really saving either.

But not anymore. Because at the end of the day, money is a means, not the end.

And I don’t want to be someone who saves all their life, only to find no time or energy left to enjoy it.

The key is balance — spending wisely, not impulsively. Finding a system that keeps you both grounded and guilt-free.

So now, I follow the 2X Rule.

Whenever I want to make a big purchase, I make sure I also invest the same amount into an appreciating asset.

Say I want sneakers worth ₹20,000 — I’ll only buy them if I’m also ready to invest ₹20,000.

It's not about restricting yourself. It's about creating a habit that supports both joy and financial growth.

And while IIT, IIM or MBBS may not be every child’s path — the point is simple: whatever path they choose, it’s going to cost more than we think.

We all want to give our kids the best shot at quality education.

But that dream needs a plan.

Here’s what you can do depending on your child’s age:

1. If your child is under 9:
– You have a long-time horizon (8–10+ years)
– Start a SIP in equity mutual funds
– Given the long duration, you can allocate assets as:
80% Equity | 10% Gold | 10% Debt.
– Increase investments yearly as your income grows
– You can also consider government-backed schemes like PPF or SSY for added stability.

2. If your child is 10–12:
– You still have a good 5-7 years
– Go for a mix of equity and debt with lower risk, still some growth.
– Allocation: 30–40% Equity | 5–10% Gold (optional) | 60–70% Debt

3. If your child is 13–16:
– The goal is near — focus should be on capital protection
– Shift completely to debt instruments:
90% Debt Funds | 10% Cash/Bank Deposits (for immediate needs)
– Avoid equity and market-linked volatility

Some simple reminders:

– De-risk 2–3 years before college — move from equity to safer options
– Consider international index funds — useful for diversification + currency benefit

You may not know exactly what your child will pursue — but not preparing because of that uncertainty? That’s a risk in itself.

Ever felt paralyzed by a big goal? You're not alone. Many of us avoid tasks that seem overwhelming.

But what if I told you there's a simple, yet powerful way to overcome procrastination?

So, last year, I faced this challenge when I started writing my book – a task that terrified me.

I had all these ideas but couldn’t figure out where to start. Every time I sat down to write, I was overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the project.

So, I did what most of us do when we’re stuck: I procrastinated.

But the longer I avoided it, the worse I felt.

I knew I had to find a way to make progress without feeling defeated before I even began.

So, I made a tiny promise to myself: write just 200 words a day.

That’s it. No pressure to create a masterpiece. Just 200 words.

At first, it seemed almost too easy.

But something amazing happened. Those 200 words often turned into 500, sometimes even 2000!

The simple act of writing daily built a momentum I never expected. And before I knew it, I had a full first draft.

All from one simple microcommitment.

And this approach isn’t limited to writing.

Micro-commitments work for any goal, and here’s why: they bypass our brain's resistance to change.

These small, manageable steps create a snowball effect, turning tiny actions into life-changing results.

And here’s how you can harness this approach for your own goals:

1. The 10-Minute Rule: Commit to just two minutes of your desired activity daily. For example, if you want to write a book, start with ten minutes of writing each morning.

2. The ""One Thing"" Method: Identify the single most impactful action you can take today. Reach out to one potential client or mentor per day.

3. The 1% Improvement Principle: Aim to get just 1% better each day. Learn one new word in a foreign language daily.

4. Time-Block Sprints: Dedicate short, focused bursts to your goal. For instance, 10-minute-deep work sessions with no distractions.

By incorporating micro-commitments into your routine, you can overcome procrastination and make meaningful progress toward your goals.

Have you tried this approach before? What small commitment can you make today to move closer to your aspirations?

In 2019, I was in my second year of college. I was laser-focused on becoming an investment banker.
NCFM, NISM, FRM, CFA Level 1, I was grinding through every certification I could get my hands on.

But something bothered me. I saw classmates around me, smart, ambitious students, completely lost when it came to building a finance career. They had the intent but zero guidance.
That's when it hit me.

What if I could teach everything I was learning?

Finladder was born from that simple idea. Help people who want to build careers in finance. Share the knowledge. Bridge the gap.

The grind was insane. Attending college classes, then rushing back to handle customers and solve student doubts. Some nights I'd fall asleep on my keyboard.

But every review that dropped, every thank-you message from a student who landed their dream job, that was my fuel.

Each piece of feedback made me work harder and reach more people.
And just like that, we scaled Finladder to an 8-figure company.

This journey has taught me the biggest lessons of my life:

💡Impact over income. When you genuinely solve problems, money follows naturally.

💡Your network is everything. Every student I helped became an advocate. Word-of-mouth built this business.

💡Consistency beats intensity. Small daily actions compound into extraordinary results.

💡Feedback is gold. Every complaint, every suggestion, I treated it as free consulting to improve.

💡Time is your only real asset. I stopped trying to do everything and focused on what moved the needle.

Today, thousands of finance professionals trace their career success back to Finladder. We're still bootstrapped, still growing, and still obsessed with student success.

Here's what I tell every confused student. 👇

Career trials are better than career traps.

A year ago, a DU BCom student reached out to me. He was stuck on whether to pursue CFA; the investment seemed huge, and everyone kept telling him how difficult it was.

Yesterday, he texted me: ""Sir, I just cleared CFA Level 1! Thank you for your advice; it made all the difference.""

Here's what changed everything.

Back then, when he was almost convinced he couldn’t do CFA, instead of pushing him toward or away from CFA, I suggested something simple:
""Try some NCFM/NISM courses first. They'll give you the clarity you're looking for.""

He did exactly that. Those short-term courses helped him understand if finance was actually his thing. Turns out, it was.

Look, if you're confused about any career path, whether it's CFA, MBA, CA, or any other field, and you have even 0.1% doubt, here's my advice:
Test the waters first.

Do a short-term course in that field. Take a weekend workshop. Shadow someone for a week. Whatever it takes to get a real taste of what you're signing up for.

Because you'll quickly figure out:

💡Does this actually interest you?
💡Can you see yourself doing this for years?
💡Are you just attracted to the idea of it, or the reality too?

This approach will save you time, money, and the frustration of being stuck in something that never felt right.

How brands reach customers. How we make purchasing decisions.

The whole ""search and scroll"" era of commerce?
It's about to feel as outdated as dial-up internet.

This isn't just another AI tool.
It's the first glimpse of how we'll discover and buy everything in the next decade.

CFA: ₹3-4 lakhs total (and you can keep working while studying)
The math here is brutal if you're not careful.


💡RECOGNITION

CFA has one global standard. Whether you're in Mumbai or New York, a CFA is a CFA.
MBA value depends heavily on the college brand. IIM vs unknown college? Completely different outcomes.


💡WHAT YOU'LL ACTUALLY LEARN

The CFA curriculum is constantly updated with real industry trends. You'll learn valuation, financial modelling, and risk management at a deep level.
MBA finance courses touch these topics but stay surface-level. You get breadth, not depth.


💡FLEXIBILITY

CFA: Study while working. No career break needed.
MBA: Full-time programmes require 1-2 years away from income. That's another ₹10-15 lakhs in lost earnings.


💡THE SUPPLY-DEMAND REALITY

This shocked me: There are millions of MBA holders in India. But only 200,000 CFA charter holders worldwide across 164 countries.
Simple economics: scarcity creates value.


💡WHO SHOULD CHOOSE WHAT?

Choose CFA if you want to work in:
→ Investment banking
→ Asset management
→ Financial research
→ Portfolio management

Choose an MBA if you want to:
→ Switch industries completely
→ Move into general management
→ Explore different business functions
→ Build a broad business network


💡MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION?

I always advise people to go for both an MBA and a CFA because they complement each other perfectly.

An MBA builds leadership, strategic thinking, and networking skills, helping you transition into management roles, while a CFA gives you deep expertise in finance, making you a strong technical specialist.

Together, they not only enhance your credibility in the finance industry but also open leadership roles for you globally, giving you the flexibility to work across industries and geographies at the highest levels!

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaanarora30/,"Unpopular opinion: Leaving your parent's house can be the best decision you can ever make! 

Before dropping a “How can you even say that?"" comment, hear me out!

This one decision will not only teach you invaluable lessons that you missed out on over the past 18 years in just one year, but it will also set you up to live your best life moving forward.

Here’s how!

💡Independence: When you move out, you take control of your life. You learn to rely on yourself for everything, from managing your time to making decisions about your day. This independence builds confidence because you realize you can handle challenges on your own.

💡Responsibility: Living alone means you’re in charge of all the responsibilities that come with it, like paying rent and keeping your space clean. This experience helps you develop a strong sense of responsibility. You’ll quickly learn the importance of paying bills on time and maintaining a tidy living space, which prepares you for future responsibilities in a job or family life.

💡Life Skills: Moving out pushes you to learn practical skills that you might not have mastered while living at home. You’ll learn to cook for yourself, do laundry, and manage household chores.
💡Financial Independence and Management: Moving out teaches you crucial money management skills. You'll learn to budget, track expenses, and understand living costs like rent and utilities.

💡Social Skills: Moving out often means meeting new people, whether it’s roommates, neighbours, or new friends. This social interaction helps you improve your communication and interpersonal skills. Engaging with others in a shared living space teaches you about compromise, cooperation, and conflict resolution, important skills for both personal and professional relationships.

💡Emotional Growth: Living independently can be emotionally challenging at times, whether it's feeling lonely or dealing with stress. Learning to cope with these feelings on your own helps build emotional resilience.

💡Adaptability: Living independently often involves encountering unexpected situations, from moving to a new city to changing jobs. These experiences teach you to adapt and be flexible in the face of change.

Leaving your parents' house can be tough, but it’s also an exciting chance to learn about yourself and the world. Every experience, good or bad, helps you become a stronger and more confident person.

Thoughts?💡","Ishaan Arora, FRM"
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ishaanarora30/,"Here are 5 pieces of advice I’d give to my younger self! (YJHD version) 

💡Go with the flow, but don’t drift aimlessly.

Dreams will shift as you grow, and that’s okay. “Kabhi kabhi lagta hai meri zindagi alag-alag directions mein ja rahi hai,” and that's how it's supposed to be in your 20s. Embrace the uncertainty, but also take charge when it matters. Life will throw you in different directions, but it's up to you to decide where you land.

💡Follow What Excites You, Even If It Seems Unrelated.

I started with finance, ended up in entrepreneurship, and who knows what’s next? Bunny once said, “Main udna chahta hoon, daudna chahta hoon, girna bhi chahta hoon... bas rukna nahi chahta.” That's what your 20s are for, trying things out, even if they seem random. Every new experience adds to your story and opens doors you never knew existed.

💡Adapt, Adjust, and Move Forward.

There’s no perfect plan, and that's where many people get stuck. Bunny didn’t wait around for the ideal opportunity; he created his own. It’s the same with your career. Things won’t always go as planned, so learn to adapt quickly, adjust your goals, and keep moving forward. The only constant is change, so make it your friend.

💡Let your dreams evolve.

The dreams I had at 21 aren’t the same ones I have today. Back then, I was chasing Wall Street; now, I’m chasing impact, fulfilment, and a life that’s uniquely mine. Don’t cling to old dreams just because they were once important. Allow them to evolve as you do.

💡Stay open to possibilities.

When I was younger, I had my path all mapped out. But “Kahin pohonchne ke liye kahin se nikalna zaroori hota hai.” Sometimes you have to step away from the script and let life surprise you. Keep an open mind; you might find your true calling where you least expect it.

I never became the investment banker I once aspired to be, and thank goodness for that. Because today, I’m living a life that’s meaningful, unpredictable, and uniquely mine.

The journey might take you somewhere different from what you imagined, but it will be worth it as long as you keep moving, keep dreaming, and keep growing.

After all, “Dil kuch aur maange toh mat rokna.” Let your dreams change; let your life surprise you. That’s the magic of your 20s. ⭐","Ishaan Arora, FRM"

And a very dear friend🌟

I started my own podcast very recently and uploaded the first episode with her yesterday on YouTube!

But what did we talk about?

“𝐂𝐀 𝐢𝐬 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐰𝐡𝐨𝐥𝐞 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞!”

Every CA aspirant has heard this at least once in their life. For years, aspiring CAs have been sold a dream that life begins and ends with clearing those exams. That once you’re a CA, balance sheets worth crores will just magically appear on your desk.


But what happens when that dream starts feeling more like a never-ending loop of attempts after attempts?

In the latest episode of 𝑷𝒆𝒑 𝑻𝒂𝒍𝒌𝒔 𝒘𝒊𝒕𝒉 𝑰𝒔𝒉𝒂𝒂𝒏, I sat down with CA Neha Datta, who spent 9 years chasing the CA dream.

A CA turned entrepreneur and creator. In this episode we have covered some of the biggest questions every CA aspirant faces.


𝐇𝐞𝐫𝐞’𝐬 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐰𝐞 𝐭𝐚𝐥𝐤𝐞𝐝 𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐮𝐭:
➟ Is CA still worth it these days?
➟ When is it time to quit CA if you're not making progress?
➟ Are alternatives like CPA, ACCA, or CMA better than CA?
➟ Does the number of attempts in CA really matter? Does it define your success?
➟ Can CA be enough, or should you look at other skills too?
➟ How do you cope with repeated failures in the CA journey?
➟ How do you handle the pressure from society and fear of failing?
➟ Is CA your whole life?
➟ What mindset shift helps if you’re not passing on your first try?
If you're someone who is planning to do CA or someone who has been pouring years into CA and still doesn’t know if it’s worth it, this episode is for you.

2022-2024: How do you manage 2 businesses and keep up with content on 3 platforms?

From networking events to family functions to friends reunions, almost everyone asks me the same question!

It all comes down to one thing: effective time management.⏰

18-year-old Ishaan didn’t know anything about it; just went with the flow; life disciplined me!

Here are the time-management strategies that help me stay productive and avoid burnout!

⏳Apply the Eisenhower matrix:
Sort tasks into four categories: urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, and neither. This method helps you focus on tasks that add the most value while pushing aside distractions.

⏳Use the Pomodoro Technique:
Work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. Repeat this cycle, and after completing four cycles, take a longer break (15–30 minutes). This method helps maintain focus and prevents burnout.

⏳Use the 2-Minute Rule for Small Tasks:
If a task takes two minutes or less, do it immediately. This keeps minor tasks from piling up and clears your schedule for more significant work.

⏳Apply Time Blocking to High-Energy Periods:
Instead of just blocking out time on your calendar, match your most demanding tasks to the times of day when you have the most energy. This makes difficult tasks easier and leaves less mentally taxing work for low-energy times.

⏳Apply Parkinson’s Law:
Set tighter deadlines for tasks to force yourself to focus and complete them faster. Parkinson’s Law states that ""work expands to fill the time available,"" so giving yourself less time can boost productivity.

⏳Follow the Rule of Three:
At the start of each day, identify the three most important tasks you need to accomplish. By focusing on just three big things, you can keep your priorities clear and your workload manageable.

Why We Don't Have Sales Targets at Finology?

Actually, we do, but they're more like a guide; they exist for inspiration. Nothing happens if we don't meet them, and no particular individual is made a scapegoat.

Why?

We don't want to sell to people who don't want us.
Customers who want us will buy from us anyway.
Our job is to create wonderful products that solve problems.

Everything else, the customer should decide for themselves without them feeling like we are sitting on their heads to give us their money.

Why Not Sell Aggressively?

I like to flip this question: ""Why sell aggressively?""
I won't have a logical answer, because for Finology, selling aggressively is not needed:

1. We are bootstrapped.
2. We have always been profitable at the group level.
3. We don't have a large team.
4. Our distribution is free, and word of mouth is good.
5. We don't have an exit plan.
6. We work from Raipur. Our expenses are limited.
7. We are not desperate for growth at any cost.

All these factors allow us to focus on doing what we do well without worrying about the competition or a VC fund.

""You can afford this because you have a sizable social media presence.""

We have it because we have worked on building it for the last 6 years.
It didn't happen on its own; we were not born with it.
So yes, it is our strength. If we can build it, you can too.

""You will never be a unicorn.""

Agreed, to be a unicorn, you need validation from the public or private markets.

You need to take funding at a certain valuation, dilute equity, give up board seats to outsiders, and your company becomes more about satisfying the investors than solving problems.

Yes. We will never be a unicorn, not because our growth will be limited, but because our growth will certainly be slower. I don't think there is a limit to it, just because we refuse to take outside money.

We will never be a unicorn because we will probably never raise funds. Without that, price discovery doesn't happen, as no third party has validated your valuation.

Also, I think that it's more of a vanity metric.
Just because you have reached a billion-dollar valuation, why should it be treated any differently than, say, someone at 999 million or 950 million?
Why such an obsession with a particular number?

What's the harm in being well funded and using it to be a loss leader if it creates wealth?

Wealth and money should help you buy more freedom, not more stress.
The more the valuation, the bigger the hustle to justify it, provide an exit, and get more funding for future growth.

Company culture is ruined, everyone is chasing numbers, and customer experience is compromised.

We don't want to win, rule, or capture the world. We don't want more of your wallet or attention. We just want you to use our products at a reasonable price to earn financial freedom.

In comparison, PMS AUM grew at around 16% CAGR.

What's surprising is that AIFs require a much higher minimum investment₹1 crore, compared to ₹50 lakh for PMS.

So why are wealthy Indians choosing AIFs over PMS?

1. AIFs are pooled funds like mutual funds that are invested in alternative assets.
2. Category III AIFs invest in both listed and unlisted companies, derivatives, and use complex trading strategies (like hedge funds).
3. They can borrow or use leverage up to twice their fund size to try to earn better returns.
4. Taxes depend on how the AIF is set up (trust or LLP).

Fund managers have more freedom; unlike mutual funds, they don't have to follow rules about company size or market caps.

1. PMS means you get your own customised stock portfolio held in your own demat account.
2. You pay tax as per your personal income tax rate.
3. Primarily invested in listed stocks.
4. There are no lock-in periods; you can take your money out anytime.

Why are Category III AIFs becoming more popular?

1. You don't have to deal with demat or custody accounts; the fund handles everything.
2. The fund pays taxes, so you don't have to worry about complicated tax filings like in PMS.
3. Lock-in periods and exit fees can be negotiated, making it more investor-friendly.
4. NRIs find it simpler to invest in AIFs than PMS, which has complex rules for them.
5. AIFs offer access to unlisted shares, structured debt, and other special investments, helping diversify your portfolio and get better returns for the risk taken.

They simply move forward: curious, open, unafraid.

That’s the nature we’re born with. Fearless. Boundless. Ready to explore.

But somewhere along the way, we learn to hesitate. We build walls where once there were open fields. We call it being ""practical"", ""realistic"", ""safe"".

Fear puts on many masks: the dread of failure, the ache of rejection, the shame of not being enough.

Did you know that today we celebrate National Space Day?

The simple truth: any journey, however long, begins with the willingness to take that first step. To look at the vast expanse of space and dare to imagine walking among the stars is the ultimate moonshot, the impossible made possible. If we dream and persist, outcomes become inevitable. The greatest distance we travel is not to the stars, but from doubt to possibility.

India's space story began not with grandeur, but with faith. Dr. Vikram Sarabhai, Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, and others looked beyond budgets and hierarchies. They believed extraordinary potential lived within Indian minds.

Whenlaunched Aryabhata in 1975, it showed that possibility knows no boundaries. The Chandrayaan missions proved what happens when a nation refuses to accept that greatness belongs only to the wealthy. And Mangalyaan? At $74 million, costing less than a Hollywood film, it placed India among the world’s leading space powers, proving smart thinking, not big spending, can reach Mars.

What makes India’s space journey extraordinary is how it was achieved:

▶️ Using geography, launches from the east-coast harness Earth’s rotation for efficiency
▶️ Turning constraints into creativity, finding alternatives when resources were scarce
▶️ Making collaboration a strength, scientists, entrepreneurs, and policymakers building together

Equally inspiring is the rise of women leaders:

▶️ Ritu Karidhal, “Rocket Woman of India,” key to Mangalyaan and Chandrayaan-2
▶️ Muthayya Vanitha, the first woman project director of a lunar mission
▶️ Nandini Harinath, scientist on 14+ missions
▶️ Anuradha TK, among the first women to lead satellite projects
▶️ Tessy Thomas, the “Missile Woman of India""

The global space economy is projected to reach $1 trillion by 2040. And India is shaping this future through visionary companies & remarkable leaders.

▶️launched the first private Indian rocket.
▶️is advancing propulsion.
▶️is pioneering 3D-printed rocket engines.
▶️, aportfolio company, is tackling orbital debris with space traffic management.

Momentum is matched by policy. India’s first dedicated space fund is not just capital; it institutionalizes belief. It connects research with markets, mentors with founders, and capital with bold ideas.

As we stand at this inflection point, space exploration reminds us it is ultimately about human exploration, our quest to understand our place in the cosmos & push beyond boundaries once thought permanent.

That is the meaning of National Space Day: not only a celebration of technology, but of the human spirit that transforms dreams into reality.

Extensive work has been done over the years to decipher the purpose and power of dreams. While dreams can happen during various sleep stages, it’s during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep that the most vivid and surreal experiences unfold. Some studies even hint that dreaming plays a role in problem-solving and emotional processing, subtly helping us sort out our feelings and ideas overnight.

Scientists have explored a new frontier of the mind. They tried creating a dialogue between two people’s dreams using advanced devices that track brain waves and monitor sleep patterns in real-time.

Here’s how it unfolded:

➡️ Participants in the experiment were fitted with equipment to track their brain activity and guide them through lucid dreaming.
➡️ During this state, scientists transmitted a word in a unique language called ""Remmyo"" to one participant.
➡️ Through monitoring and brain stimulation, they established a two-way communication channel, allowing dreamers to respond to questions and even influence each other’s dreams.

Imagine being able to relay a message mid-dream what could that mean for human connection and our understanding of shared subconscious experiences?

While we’re not quite at the level of sharing full conversations or orchestrating shared dreamscapes like in the movie ‘Inception’, and god forbid manipulating dreams, this research cracks open the door to that possibility.

Makes me wonder if we could eventually download our dreams like movies.

Mathematician Ramanujan claimed that he solved many complex mathematical problems with answers received in his dreams.

Almost every venture capitalist is looking for that founder who ‘dreams big’.

Many across India are familiar with the unique, divine taste of the Tirupati prasadam, a cherished gift from friends & family returning from the holy pilgrimage. Its special flavor is often attributed to the purity of its preparation and the sacred intention behind it. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) strictly controls the procurement of ingredients to maintain this unparalleled quality & taste, earning the unwavering trust of millions of devotees.

What many may not know is that one of its key ingredients is ghee from 𝘕𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘪, the beloved dairy brand from Karnataka. The familiar blue-&-white packet in our refrigerator is a part of the everyday rituals.

But before Nandini , milk was scarce, farmers trapped in poverty, & the state was importing milk powder, a bitter irony for a land dotted with cattle.

In 1974, the Karnataka Dairy Development Corporation (KDDC) was launched to fix that. By 1983, the brand ‘Nandini’ was born. A year later, KDDC became the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF).

The obstacles were daunting: Rocky terrain. Scattered farms. No cold chains. Yet, the cooperative model took root.

Today, Nandini is India’s second-largest dairy cooperative:
• ₹17,000+ crore turnover (FY 2023)
• 2.6 M farmers
• 26,000+ village-level societies
• ~8.5 M litres of milk collected daily

And it’s not just milk. Nandini now offers 18 product categories: ghee, paneer, curd, sweets, flavored milk, chocolate, butter, ice cream, eco-friendly milk packets & cattle feed.

Quality? Every litre undergoes multi-stage testing for adulteration, antibiotics & spoilage at the source and chilling plants. They’ve earned the trust of millions by not cutting corners.

In 2020, when COVID crashed milk prices, private players slashed what they paid farmers. Nandini didn’t. They kept paying full rates, absorbing losses to protect livelihoods. When we put people first, we build systems that endure.

Some curious facts:
• Nandini pioneered biodegradable packaging in Bengaluru
• Vertical milk pouch expansion (1.05L at proportional cost)  a consumer-first move
• Its brand value is now $1.079 billion, among India’s top 5 F&B names
• Farmers are paid directly and fairly, earnings are insulated from market volatility

There’s no single “founder,” but generations of rural leaders, policymakers, and cooperative members made this success possible.

𝘕𝘢𝘯dini is proof of quiet revolutions that create deep societal impact built on dignity, trust, & a belief that villages must have a role in powering economies.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vanikola/,"Do you own a 𝐋𝐚𝐛𝐮𝐛𝐮 𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐥? Those odd, spiky-toothed fluffballs from Hong Kong based on Nordic folklore? Thanks to TikTok virality and shoutouts from celebrities, they jumped from niche shelf fillers to black-market gold, some editions auctioning for $170K, driving Pop Mart’s $419 million revenue with a 727% sales surge in just one year.

I don’t own one, but I am curious student of how products go viral.

And matcha? Once a centuries-old Japanese tea ritual, it has now become a $4.2 billion market. I don’t really like the taste of Matcha. Despite its grassy bitterness, millions are gulping down that “calm, energized influencer vibe.”

A few months ago, Prada walked Kolhapuri chappals down the runway at Milan. The global fashion world gasped, rushing to buy a pair. Meanwhile, most Indians have a pair of these in their home, wondering what the sudden global interest is all about.

When trends hijack our wallets and feeds, are we really buying value, or simply responding to stimuli? I am firmly convinced, it is the stimuli, and however vigilant, I am being manipulated every day through algorithms pushing products and content at me.

A recent Stanford study of 35,000+ people found that deactivating Facebook or Instagram for just six weeks led to:
✅ A 4% increase in people reporting they felt “happy often.”
✅ Significant drops in anxiety and depression.
✅ Well-being gains comparable to those offered by 15–22% of cognitive therapy.
✅ The most significant boost for women under 25.

Even when many switched to other apps, they still felt better. It wasn’t screen time, it was about the addictive content we consume.

So here’s the deeper question I’ve been mulling over: What are we actually buying into? We like to believe we’re making choices. But more often, we’re reacting to stimuli: powerful, repetitive, emotional nudges that speak to our primal need to belong. It’s a complex cocktail of belonging, identity, aspiration, and the primal desire to be part of the tribe.

It’s the same reason animals display feathers, scents, or rituals. To establish dominance, attract food, acceptance into the pack or win the female.

We’re not so different. We just use avocado toast and reels instead of mating calls. And even when we know we’re being manipulated, we smile for the photo, add a filter, and post it anyway.

The real irony? I hate matcha, but I swear by avocado toast. And yes, I’ve probably posted about the perfect avocado toast more than once. So even when we think we are above one mad trend, we are probably adding to another.

We're all in it, the smart, the mindful, the skeptical. Sometimes, the only choice left is to laugh at our own patterns. and occasionally unplug and ask: “Is this truly me or just my reaction to the feed?”

Back in 2014, Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar painted a future where humanity reaches for the stars in search of survival.

Once the space economy was for Isac Asimov books (any Foundation fans?) and sci-fi movies. But if you look at the numbers today, it’s a trillion-dollar reality. The future is unfolding as an empire-building mission.

From asteroid mining to lunar colonies, from space tourism to interplanetary internet, the race is on. But what are we really chasing? Expansion or escape?

SpaceX is aiming for a human mission to Mars by 2027, while NASA’s Artemis program is sketching blueprints for a sustainable lunar base by the 2030s. The safe return of astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore from extended missions reaffirms that human endurance in space is no longer a barrier.

Space tourism is moving from fiction books to reality. Virgin Galactic has already sold 800+ tickets at $450,000 a piece.

Space-based solar power could reshape the energy industry, beaming limitless renewable energy from space to Earth, too. I met companies interested in putting large datacenters in space, bringing a new reality to cloud computing by putting it literally in the cloud! This could transform latency, security, and global connectivity, reshaping our digital experiences radically.

Meanwhile, the billionaires may become trillionaires on space opportunity. Asteroid mining, once a thought experiment, is now an industry in the making with 700 quintillion dollars worth of metals floating in the abyss waiting to be claimed.

There’s also a silent crisis that is building above us. More than 34,000 pieces of space debris are orbiting Earth. They are threatening satellites and future missions.

-backeddelivers accurate and real-time orbital insights to ensure safer space operations, whereas startups likeandare racing to clean up before orbital traffic spirals out of control.

But as technology accelerates, a larger question looms: who owns space?

The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 was written when the Moon landing was still a dream. Today, private companies and nations are testing their limits, setting the stage for geopolitical tensions beyond Earth’s atmosphere. The next space race seems all about control.

One thing is certain: the cosmos is the next frontier of ambition, greed, and survival.
We left footprints on the Moon, but our hearts stayed Earthbound. Are we explorers, or just wanderers chasing power?

Can you read this? It might just be a life-saving skill. It spells: Morse Code.

Most of us have heard of Morse Code but rarely think about its relevance. It’s that language of dots and dashes that was the world’s first binary communication system long before computers and 1s and 0s.

Invented in the 1830s by Samuel Morse, it was originally designed for the telegraph. Before telephones existed, this was our first instant messaging system for long distances.

At its heart, it’s deceptively simple:
Dot (·) = one unit of time
Dash (–) = three units
Pauses between letters and words are coded too. But its impact? Anything but simple.

In 1844, Samuel Morse sent the first long-distance message:
“What hath God wrought”
.-- .... .- - / .... .- - .... / --. --- -.. / .-- .-. --- ..- --. .... -
between Washington and Baltimore.

In 1901, the first transatlantic message wasn’t a letter or a phone call, it was Morse Code, beamed from the US to Europe, bouncing off the atmosphere.

SOS (··· ––– ···) became the universal distress signal, famously used by the Titanic.
NASA has used Morse Code for deep-space communications where standard radio transmissions struggle.

Though no longer mandatory for maritime operators, Morse Code is far from dead. It thrives among ham radio enthusiasts. Why? It cuts through static better than voice. Needs minimal power. Can be tapped, flashed, or even blinked.

There are thousands of amateur radio clubs worldwide. Many host Morse practice nets, competitions to see who can decode fastest, and even classes for newcomers.

Why would anyone still use it?
1. Emergencies: When voice fails, a flashlight or tapping can say SOS.
2. Military survival training: Soldiers learn to blink or tap messages when captured.
3. Tech inspiration: Morse was the original compression system, paving the way for digital code.

A fun fact: In the United States, the final commercial Morse code transmission was on July 12, 1999. It signed off poetically with Morse’s original message: “What hath God wrought.”

Remember Interstellar? A watch transmits Morse to solve a vital equation that saves humanity. Morse reminds us that not all systems need to be complex. Sometimes simple, elegant, and usable is exactly what you need.

For fun—can you decode these?

At its IPO in 1986, Microsoft generated $61 million in annual revenue with a market capitalization of $777 million. Today, Microsoft’s most recent quarterly revenue (Q3 FY25) is over $70 billion. Its full-year revenue for 2024 was $236.6 billion. And its market capitalization now sits around $3.6 trillion.

For companies, there is often only growth or decline.

Think of BlackBerry or Nokia. Once market leaders. Now largely irrelevant.

Revenue is one measure of growth, but the underlying drivers that translate to future revenue are much more multifaceted.

So how should we evaluate growth? Revenue alone is not an indicative metric.

Current market share or dominance doesn’t promise longevity.

What matters is what’s deeper, harder to measure, but essential to the future.

The brand is another important metric for every business. It buys time, trust, and resilience.

You don’t need to know Amul’s revenue to trust and buy their products. It’s in every kitchen, across generations. For the record, Amul is aiming to become a ₹1 trillion brand by 2025-26. That’s legacy in motion.

We often default to metrics we can track:
* Revenue
* User Acquisition
* Valuation Milestones
* Market Share

Structural growth is about discipline, reach, reliability, & scale. Think why you buy from brands like Amazon, TATA, or LIC.

You may or may not love these brands, but you use them. That’s a value metric; operational excellence & trust in the service make them essential.

Then there are brands like boAt. It didn’t chase premium positioning. It understood the youth mindset. Durable, stylish, affordable products paired with clever, lifestyle-first marketing.

Growth isn’t a single thing. It’s both the visible & the invisible. The numbers you share in decks, validated by accountants. But what the customers say about you is the story behind those numbers. The intangibles that translate to future revenue.

Compounding growth is based on strong numbers today and investing in new markets and technologies for tomorrow. Taking bold risks in an ever-changing world should be part of an organisation’s DNA.

My job as a VC is less about valuing today’s metrics & more about understanding the intangibles that drive the possibility of exponential growth.

When I hear your story, I want to hear the past, the present, & the future.

The 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁 is why you started this company; what problem or insight sparked the journey?

The 𝗽𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗲𝗻𝘁 is how you’ve translated that idea into action; what you’ve built, delivered, and earned customer trust.

The 𝗳𝘂𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 is how you see compounding your business; how you’ll grow markets, deepen moats, and create lasting value.

And that story has to address what truly drives growth for your business. Why investing now is likely to create compounding returns in the years ahead.

4. High Margins = Only Reality.
EPO (Earnings Per Order) Obsession.

5. Data is religion. Every click, each footfall, returns, reviews, vs peer KPIs?
✓Measured. Optimized. Compounded.

Results?
» Add ~₹2K Cr new revenue each yr in last 3 yrs, FY24 ~₹5.4K Cr rev (15% profit)
» Cash on books: ~₹600 Cr!

• Rule of 40 = Revenue Growth % + EBITDA %
✓ Healthy? >40% , Below? Burn to die.

• Cohort Retention: If your Day 30, 60, 90 retention looks like a cliff.. leaky bucket.

• Burn Multiple = Net Burn / Net New ARR.
✓ Steady? < 1.5x , Deadly? > 2.5x .

• Gross Margin per Employee = Total GM pool / Headcount.
✓ Benchmark to your global mkt leader. Bloated teams = Shrinking margins.

• Growth Efficiency Index (GEI) = Net New ARR / Sales & Marketing Spend

Top 3 pools in AI Infra (capex) race where billions are flowing into?

Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Meta collectively spent ~$177 BILLION on capital expenditures in the last 12 months (Grew ~4x in last 4 years)!

~50% of all these spends = data center kit = GPUs, storage, & networking.

More simple words,
✓ Real estate (Tech, CRE)
✓ Power (electricity, nuclear)

1. Data Center Revenues : Dell made ~$3.2 Bn in AI server sales (highest last quarter), its peer SMCI had ~$5.3 Bn in revenue (up 143% YoY).

2. GPUs : Nvidia did $26.3B in data center revenue (last quarter), of which ~$3.7B came from networking and ~45% from cloud providers.

Fun fact: NVIDIA is projected to sell ~2 Mn of H100s in 2024, close to no. of cars Tesla would sell in the same year.

- Nvidia sells one H100 for ~$40k, Gross margin ~$28k
- Tesla sells a car for ~$46k, Gross margin ~$9k.

3. Real Estate and Power : Recently, PJM Interconnection - the largest electrical grid operator in the USA, had an annual power auction in a region that is also world's largest data center hub - northern Virgina.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/iamnehanagar/,"40 LPA job offer means 3 Lakh monthly salary, right? 

WRONG.

Here’s why.

Most freshers don’t understand the difference between CTC and in-hand salary.

Here's an example of what your 40 LPA job offer actually looks like.

- Base salary: 12 Lakhs
- Joining bonus: 6 Lakhs
- Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOPs): 15 Lakhs
- Performance bonus: 4 Lakhs
- Retention bonus: 1 Lakh
- Allowances: 2 Lakhs

Let’s break down each component:

- Base salary: in-hand salary (1L/month, 85k post tax).
- Joining bonus: one-time, only for the 1st year.
- ESOPs: equity shares of the company are given.
- Performance bonus: for achieving all target metrics.
- Retention bonus: given when you stay for 1 or 2 years.
- Allowances: include meal vouchers and travel claims.

What seems like a 3L/month salary is actually 95k/month in year 1 and 82k/month from year 2.

Most people plan their lifestyle with CTC in mind, and get stuck financially when reality hits.

Stop planning your life around total CTC.

Talking about finances can be difficult, but it's important to do it. Financial problems are one of the leading causes of divorce, and these red flags are the reasons why:

- They refuse to talk about finances. This is a big red flag. If your partner is unwilling to discuss finances with you, it's a sign that they may be hiding something. Or, it could mean that they're not very good at managing their money.

- They hide their spending habits. If your partner is always making excuses for why they can't show you their receipts, or if they're constantly buying new things without telling you, it's a sign that they're not being honest with you about their spending.

- Gambling problems or any other addiction that is expensive. If your partner has a gambling problem or any other addiction that is expensive, it can put a huge strain on your finances. It's important to talk to your partner about their addiction and get them help if needed.

- They are in charge of the money. If your partner is in charge of the money and you have no access to it, it's a red flag. This could mean that they're controlling your finances or that they're not being transparent with you about how they're spending your money.

- They have zero concern for their or your financial future. If your partner doesn't save for retirement or if they're constantly racking up debt, it's a sign that they're not thinking about the future. This could lead to financial problems down the road.

If you see any of these red flags in your relationship, it's important to talk to your partner about them.

A Reddit post is going viral—and it’s a wake-up call for every aspiring international student.

An Indian student took a ₹40 lakh education loan to study abroad, hoping for a high-paying job.

But after graduation, He was not able to get an overseas job.

Now back in India, he earns ₹75,000/month—but pays ₹66,000/month in EMIs.
That leaves just ₹9,000/month to survive.

This isn’t a one-off case.
It’s a growing pattern.

Why?
-Tighter visa norms
-Companies preferring local hires
-Global slowdown in tech hiring
- Skyrocketing cost of international education

A foreign degree no longer guarantees a foreign job.

And without a job abroad, repaying a foreign loan from Indian salaries becomes financially unsustainable.

Now he has to face:

-Delayed life goals—no savings, no investments, no home planning
-Constant mental stress—every month is a financial balancing act
-Years lost in recovery—when peers are investing, he's just surviving

So, before investing ₹40–50 lakhs in education, students and parents must analyse:

-What is the post-study work visa landscape?
-What is the average placement rate and salary in that country?
-Is the degree aligned with high-demand skills?
-What is the break-even period for ROI?

(I call it a dump because my house was next to a hill of garbage)

To go to office: I would walk to Akshardham Metro station. And, the line would stretch (sometimes) even outside the station during peak office hours.

To beat this traffic, I would leave early, carry a physical book. I read 1 book every week standing/sitting in a metro. That's how I learnt to read fast.

I stayed back at my office for as long as possible & prepared for GMAT (so that I didn't have to come back home to a dump). Did this for 1.5 years: and, I ended up getting a 99th%ile, the highest achievable score.

I had no real plans of applying to study abroad. I just couldn't afford it (I wanted to but couldn't afford). But, I knew that if I aced the GMAT, I could teach foreign clients, who would pay well.

99th percentile score gave that ticket. So I started teaching. Got some private clients. And, I moved to a better place.

Life started changing bit-by-bit: my student (who was applying for an Executive MBA) encouraged me to apply abroad. So I did. And, got into some of the best programs with scholarships.

So is India richer than Singapore? 

Here is a quick backstory:-

By 2047, we will be a 40 Tr$ economy.
And, by this point, we will be a developed economy.

This is a matter of great celebration. NO DOUBT.
And, we should be proud.

Having said this, if you look around, you will find that India ranks around 140th on GDP/Capita. No one seems to even talk about this number (like ever!).

This means that while India is growing GDP wise, an 'average' Indian is still quite poor.

Question comes WHY?

[1] Our GDP comes from domestic consumption, not exports. For decades we have run, trade deficit, not trade surplus (i.e we import more and export less)

[2] Singapore on the other hand, runs a trade surplus. In 2021 for example, they had a trade surplus of 126Bn$, which is almost 32% of their GDP.

[3] Interestingly, Japan, Germany, China (three countries which are ahead of us in terms of GDP), all run trade surplus (generally)

US is the only exception that runs a trade deficit (like India). But, they are a special case as they hold the reserve currency.

They can print their fake money and buy real goods from the world to the extent they want. And, still not cause a panic.

So to cut the long-story short, I don't know if India is richer than Singapore. May be it is, may be it is not.

Logically speaking, I don't know if a country can truly become rich without running a trade surplus.

Even if we look at history, this holds true. For 1700 years, India controlled 25-33% of world's wealth. Even during this phase, India was a net exporter of finished good.

(2) You own a home.

Home ownership among young people is dropping fast. With food, housing, and medical inflation at all-time highs, having a house is a massive advantage.

- VCs were running after DotCom firms. Same now with AI.
- Governments running to build DotCom infra (fibre optics, research etc) -- same now with AI.
- Businesses pivoting to DotCom. Same now with AI.

So will the AI revolution end like the DotCom crash?

My answer is a NO.

Reason: during the DotCom bubble, there was massive inflation of supply infrastructure. Here is an important paragraph you should read:-

By early 2000s: Telecom companies raised almost $2 trillion in equity and $600 billion in debt—much of this capital was spent building more than 80 million miles of fiber optic cable in the U.S. alone. By 2005, as much as 85% of those cables were still unused (“dark fiber”). This led to plummeting bandwidth prices and eventually, serious financial losses and bankruptcies in the telecom sector.

The supply was built well ahead of the demand.

“Fanboying much?”

Let me set the record straight:

I don’t care about the course. I care about the cold truth in this post

2 Cr becoming 535 Cr in 40 years = power of compounding
That 535 Cr having the buying power of just 35 Cr = power of inflation.

I didn’t need a calculator to know this hurts. I lived it.

Back in 2021, I went to Canada for a master’s. Tuition, rent, life, all in, I spent around 45L. Just last month, out of curiosity, I checked the current cost of the same program.

55L For the exact same degree.
Same college. Same course. Just… more expensive.

That’s a 10L inflation punch in less than 5 years.

1) Start with 1% of your net-worth. Pick up the challenge of investing it in the markets.

2) In year 1: take the challenge of NOT losing this money. Even if you make 0% returns, it is fine.

Buy Index, buy some bluechips. Read, iterate. Take courses, read books.

3) In year 2: go a level deeper. Try rotating your capital. If you see gains, bring 5% of your net worth in the market. Again, don't worry about returns.

4) In year 3&4: figure YOUR style of investing. Do you trade well? Do you sing trade? Are you investing long-term? Are you buying growth vs value? Should you trade options etc.

5) Time & your experiences are your best teacher.

Most people don't learn investing because its painful.

It changed the core of who they were.
I'm not judging. As there is no right answer to ""how much should you spend""

Saying things like: ""oh, spend within your limits"", begets the question: what is the ""limit""?

You can't carry your wealth in your afterlife. So the American way of borrowing & dying kind of appeals to me. It looks logical.

But, it also brings the stress of carrying the burden of debt: when you are alive and kicking.

GenZ is abandoning Google in the US, and it may just mean that India becomes the biggest market for the search engine giant. Here’s my hypothesis.

According to data by Forbes and TechCrunch, GenZ is now using platforms like TikTok, Reddit, YouTube and Pinterest to search for and discover products.

The reason? They value trusted, authentic content over sponsored results.
People are saying Google will slowly lose market share in the search category.

But here’s what’s getting missed: this shift isn’t happening everywhere.
In India, the story is very different, and it might just define Google's future.

Here’s why.

Out of the 4 platforms mentioned,

- TikTok has zero users in India. Which means it has no impact on Google search

- Reddit has 10x more users in the US than in India. The migration (when it happens) will not even be a drop in the ocean for Google

- YouTube is owned by Google, and India has nearly double the number of YouTube users compared to USA (491 million vs 253 million).

Add to it, India’s massgive GenZ population and cheap data - and it becomes clear that Google’s fastest-growing user base could be not California, but Vizag, Bhubaneshwar or Bhopal.

The latest controversy with Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot from Astronomer has already ruined two families. But here we are, adding fuel to the fire.

Some say that the two deserve the backlash for cheating on their partners. And I'm not here to debate whether or not they do.

But their families?

Do they deserve this mockery?

Imagine being in their place. Imagine your partner was caught cheating in a Coldplay concert and went viral on the intenet. And imagine that private pain become a public spectacle - An incident that was made into thousands of memes.

Every scroll you do brings fresh jokes, heated debates, and wild accusations.

And it doesn't stop there. The media circles like vultures throughout the day. And then they write articles that dig into your personal life.

All of this while you're reeling with the biggest shock of your life - that your partner, someone you raised your kids with - is cheating on you.

What's worse? Even brands joined this circus. One company made a ""funny video"" about how their tool helped Astronomer's employees get more productive, which gave the CEO and HR head more time to ""fraternise"".

2) Build content on something you know deeply. No need to quit your job. Just 1 hour a day. The internet has 5.5 billion people who can consume your content. Over time, it all compounds.

3) Learn to invest better. A 2.5% higher return than your peers can mean 40–50% more wealth in the long-term.

While I did consider “not earning any salary for a few years” as the worst case scenario before starting, no one told me about the compounding cost of entrepreneurship. Had I continued to get a salary and continued my SIPs, I'd be sitting on a 7-figure boost to my net worth today, only from the investment returns.

And that’s a problem - With entrepreneurship, no one tells you that even if you return to a job, you’ll most likely earn lesser than your peers. Because sadly, the Indian job market is still anchored to your “last drawn salary.” Two years as a founder can set you back way more than you realise.

No one tells you how it rewires your brain. I used to leave work on time back in 2019-2020, and have a life after. But Jackfruit kind of made me a workaholic. Now on some weekends, I get anxious if I haven’t opened my laptop.

That shift..feels permanent.

But do I regret starting up? Absolutely not! The experience I gained is priceless!

I only wish someone had told me that the opportunity cost of starting up isn’t just your salary. It’s a lot more - money, mental health, and living with the sting of watching your peers stay ahead, for a large part of your career.

I was talking to a friend the other day. Both of us have had a similar career trajectory - about 12/13 years of working, started as an individual contributor, then got a small team, and now leading an entire function.

She has the exact same schedule as me - Our day starts and ends with meetings. We barely get time to work on our individual stuff because most part of the day, we’re working on guiding the team, taking reviews of ongoing projects, planning the team’s next sprint/calendar/project, putting out fires, and ensuring that folks in the team get along with each other.

All of this, while being on top of everything so that at any point, we know exactly what’s going on in our function..

At times I feel like I’ve been hit by some memory loss disease, because I don’t remember something that my teammate told me 2 days ago. Then I realise that there are 199 other things I had as well, and my brain has only a finite capacity after all.

The funny part is - All of this comprises just one line in our 2-pager job description - “Manage and mentor the team to achieve their goals”

Now, most people think that the only thing managers do is “take meetings and reviews”. But that’s how they’re supposed to do their job, isn’t it?

As a manager, a lot of times I crave for the work I used to do as an Individual Contributor - writing content, analyzing data from performance campaigns, or just designing something cool on Canva. Unfortunately, I can’t do all of that now because of all these “other things”.

I used to think it gets easier as you move up the ladder. But the middle of the ladder is crazy - You’re neither at the top to focus your energy only on strategy, nor are you at the bottom to just focus on your own tasks. You’re supposed to do both. And that needs a massive amount of context switching, which drains your energy.

Okay, no. This isn’t a post cribbing about life as a manager. It’s about putting out thoughts from that perspective, so that teams can empathise with their managers.

Do I miss my work as an individual contributor? Of course I do! Because as a manager, you rarely create stuff on your own - you mostly enable the team to do it.

But do I dislike being a manager? Absolutely not. The satisfaction of grooming younger folks, taking game-changing decisions, and just making the entire machine run, hits differently.

Today, AI agents are automating end-to-end processes. And tasks that used to take weeks now take a couple of hours.

This means faster delivery. Which also means lesser people needed to do the same job.

Which in turn means that if you needed a team of 20 to solve a problem earlier, you’ll now just need a team of, maybe 3.

“Well, you’re telling me stuff I already know. How does this create more opportunities?” you ask?

Well, here’s where things get interesting - Very small, niche problems that were not economically feasible to solve because of high manpower costs, suddenly become viable, thanks to AI.

So we’ll now be able to see extremely niche problems being solved at a fraction of the cost.

Think of a loan recovery platform running with just an AI agent that calls small-ticket loan defaulters and converses with them for repayment. Such a company will need only 5 employees because they have an AI program that can work 24x7.

Or an AI-based legal tech platform that can draft basic legal agreements based on inputs given to it, in minutes. It will need a couple of senior lawyers to handle more complex agreements, but all basic agreements can be done with AI.

Or a personal AI agent that tracks an individual’s health and suggests them steps to get fitter, every day.

All these (small ticket loan recovery, legal agreements, personalised healthcare assistants) are problems that startups could not solve till now because they needed a lot of manual effort, and the revenue was not in proportion to the manpower cost.

But now, AI agents take care of all this. At scale.

Which means, we’ll see a lot of niche use cases being solved by AI - New business cases that we never saw till today will emerge.

And yet, nobody is talking about this. The narrative is still around how ""AI will take jobs"".

Well, it’s going to be a fascinating world to live in, and I’m super excited to see what the future holds.

Any such use cases you can think of, where AI will solve super niche problems? Let me know in the comments!

If we look at knowledge and experience required in a job, some roles require more knowledge and hard skills, than experience or soft skills. Think graphic designing. Analytics. Accounting.

In such jobs, obviously you’ll get better with experience, but the improvement will probably be marginal, not exponential.

Other jobs that don’t depend on hard skills per se, are the ones that need something more.

Think Sales. Consultancy. Project management.

These roles require an interplay of people skills, conflict resolution, teamwork, effective communication and more.

These are not things that can be learnt from books, YouTube or LinkedIn. They’re things that need you to understand how people behave in different situations.

They need 𝐞𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞.

An hour later, his office boy comes up with these gifts - customized mugs having my name, and some lovely chocolates.

Although the price of these mugs would not be exorbitant, but gestures like these are honestly priceless - it not only made my day, but also showed how kind, humble and sweet Mr. Damani is.

The point is pretty simple - you never know small gestures can make someone feel so special. Just go little bit beyond, and be little kind to bring a smile on someone's face - you never know it would mean the world to them!

Thank you so much, Mr. Ramesh Damani for sending this - you are truly a gem!

He pursued a US MBA that costs over $200,000 (~₹1.6 Crores).

He works in an industry where post-MBA salaries can hit $500,000 (~₹4 Crores).

He revealed how MBA interns in the US can earn $15,000 a month (~₹12 Lakhs) as their stipend.

He learned financial modeling in one weekend to crack a private equity interview.

He’s none other than.

I was amazed by his journey, but one thing he said really stood out to me. When he was in India, he used to work on 70-80% of his weekends. In the US, his weekends are almost always his own.

He explained that in the US, there's less ""busy work."" As long as you get your job done, no one expects you to stay late just to show your face. It's a culture built on efficiency, not just effort.

It's a powerful lesson. We often glorify the ""hustle"" and long hours, but the most successful people and cultures focus on a different metric: results.

It’s not about how many hours you put in; it's about what you produce in those hours.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kushallodha548/,"Is it possible to turn a ₹4 lakh investment into a $90,000 starting salary?

For many Indian CAs dreaming of a global career, this isn't just a question, it's the entire game plan.

In my latest podcast, I sat down with(CA, CPA), who made this exact journey from Mumbai to PwC in New York. We went beyond the dream and crunched the actual numbers behind the US CPA pathway.

Here’s the real, unfiltered breakdown:

💰 The Investment: The total cost for the CPA, including exam fees and good coaching, comes to about ₹3.5 - 4 lakhs.

📈 The Immediate ROI: A starting salary in a major US city like New York can range from $80,000 - $90,000 (~₹70 Lakhs). In India, a CPA can expect a starting package of ₹12-15 lakhs.

⏰ The Challenge: It’s a race against time. You have just 18 months to clear all 4 tough sections once you pass your first one.

🗽 The Reality Check: That high salary comes with high expenses. Mohit shared that rent alone in NYC can be $2,500/month (over ₹2 Lakhs!), and a simple lunch can cost $20.

But the most valuable stat he shared wasn't about money. It was about the visa. He revealed how the L1A inter-company transfer can lead to a green card in just ~3 years, bypassing the 15-20 year wait that many face on an H1B visa.

Seeing the numbers laid out like this is powerful. But as Mohit wisely pointed out, the numbers only get you in the door. It’s your performance, your adaptability, and your leadership that truly build a long-term global career.

A huge thank you to Mohit for such a transparent, data-packed session. If you want the full story behind these numbers, this episode is a must-watch.",Kushal Lodha
Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kushallodha548/,"What New York taught me? 

1. Work Life Balance – people start working early, and want to end work early. Having personal time is given a big priority. Mostly, people will start at 8.30 / 9 AM and end their day by 5.30 / 6 PM, so that they can have their personal time too. Most of the people I met used to get free by evening, and did not work on weekends at all.

2. Small Talks – I think a lot of people indulge into small talks, and people are very approachable. It is very easy to start a conversation with anyone in a subway train, or a bus, or on the street because of the open culture. I made 2 friends when I was in a subway while going to Manhattan, and they guided me where to get down etc. as I was new in the city.

3. Being independent – you have to do almost everything on your own, right from filling the fuel in your car to cleaning the car from inside, to washing your clothes, to cooking your food – there is no concept of spoonfeeding! This is primarily because of labour is very expensive, and no one would want to spend thousands of dollars on hiring a househelp.

Your perspective will surely change.

He sent a cold email to Mr. Utpal Sheth (Partner of Rakesh Jhunjhunwala) when he was 15 years old, and ended up getting an internship at RARE Enterprises twice.

He sent a cold email to Nithin Kamath, when he was 14 years old, and Nithin Kamath had tweeted about it back in 2020, that this has to be the best cold email he has ever received from a young 14 year old (tweet link -)

He has sent cold emails to multiple industry stalwarts, and ended up getting a meeting with them – including Deepak Parekh (HDFC), Ridham Desai (Morgan Stanley), and many more.

What’s his secret? Pretty simple – be crisp, introduce yourself, and have a clear ask. He taught me one very important thing – instead of writing “Could you please let me know if we can meet?”, write “Would you be please willing to meet?” – it increases the chances of getting a meeting because it sounds more polite and there has been a study done on this.

He has read more than 300 books so far, his favorite one being Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid by Douglas Hofstadter that talks about mathematics, art, music, and how meaning and intelligence emerge.

He is truly the smartest public markets investor I’d know of, and a very deep thinker. He always says “try to be a deep thinker and not a shallow thinker” – that’s a true differentiator.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhikagupta2/,"🥄 Dal‑Chawal Discipline Beats Avocado‑Toast Hype
When it comes to building wealth, the biggest secret isn’t chasing the latest fad, it’s embracing timeless discipline. In their book Mango Millionaire, Radhika Gupta and Niranjan Avasthi show that fortune favors the consistent middle‑class investor.

📚 Key takeaways that resonate:
1. Money is personal: your investing strategy should reflect your life, not someone else’s.
2. The book lays out five pillars: earn, spend, save, invest and borrow that anchor financial freedom.
3. Start where you are: build an emergency fund, begin your SIPs early, and stick with them for at least 10 years. This is how everyday choices turn into a compounding machine.

Dal‑Chawal Investing: At the India Today Conclave 2024, Radhika Gupta advised that 80 % of your portfolio should be in steady, low‑risk instruments, leaving the remaining 20 % for “pickle and chutney” funds. It’s about balance, patience and letting time work its magic

Relatable stories: the book uses Bollywood scenes, family budgets and the Great Indian Thali to make finance feel like a conversation with a friend

It’s not a dry manual; it’s an invitation to be part of the wealth‑building journey.
The message?
💡“Consistency beats intensity.” Wealth isn’t created by flashy moves, but by daily habits. Choosing dal‑chawal over avocado toast again and again. It means setting aside a little every month, focusing on the essentials and trusting the process.

If you’re ready to elevate your financial journey, start with this mindset. Embrace the dal‑chawal discipline, invest through SIPs, and let compounding work quietly in the background. Mango Millionaire is the perfect companion to help you navigate and stay the course.

🔖 Read it, reflect on it, and build the future you deserve.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/radhikagupta2/,"""Because Google isn’t enough."" 💡 
 
That’s the first line that really hooked me — and it perfectly sums up why Mango Millionaire by(with) is worth picking up. In today’s world, Google will throw thousands of answers at you, but when it comes to money, investments, and financial planning, too much random information often leaves you more confused. This book, however, stitches everything together in a way that actually makes sense.

What I loved most was howused relatable movie examples to explain heavy financial concepts. It’s rare to find a finance book that doesn’t overwhelm you with jargon, but instead feels like a conversation over coffee — with a Bollywood scene or two making the topic click instantly.

She subtly walks you through different investment classes, helping you understand their nature, risks, and suitability — and then brings home a powerful point: investing in equities isn’t a casual hobby. It’s practically a full-time job. And if you don’t have that time or expertise, one of the smartest ways is to invest in equities through mutual funds.

Another highlight for me was the chapter on Money Hygiene — one of the most underrated, yet crucial, aspects of financial wellbeing. She explains it so simply, you start wondering why it isn’t taught in schools.

For me, this isn’t just a one-time read — it’s a handbook I’ll be keeping on my desk, to revisit whenever I’m planning a new investment or reviewing my portfolio. Like a doctor’s advice to “take two pills in the morning and evening after meals,” my prescription would be: open Mango Millionaire whenever your money decisions need a check-up.

Unknown,https://www.linkedin.com/in/roman-sheremeta-14972a50/,"The U.S. economy is in real trouble — just look at the latest jobs report.

With 300+ million people, the U.S. historically added about 150,000 jobs a month, roughly in line with population growth.

Then came the pandemic crash of spring 2020: 1.4 million jobs lost in March, 20 million in April.

The rebound followed: millions of jobs added monthly in summer–fall 2020. In 2021 growth slowed, but in 2022 job creation surged to 400,000–900,000 a month — two to four times the historical norm.

By 2023, things leveled at 200–250k a month. In 2024, sometimes closer to 100k, still solid. Toward the end of Biden’s term, the pace accelerated again — some months above 300k.

Then, January 5: a new president. Winter–spring: job growth cooled to 100–120k.

Then came tariffs and deportations from farms and construction sites. May saw just 19k new jobs — the weakest in decades outside the pandemic. June: –13k — catastrophic. July: 79k — historically low again.

The response? Fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Blame the “bad numbers.” Appoint your own guy.

Didn’t help. The new chief reported only +22k in August — and revised June and July down even further.

The biggest losses? Manufacturing. Exactly where tariffs were supposed to “bring jobs back.”

The excuse? “We’re building a record number of factories. Imports are banned. Everything will be made in the U.S. Just wait.” Yet construction is also down. Where are all those workers?

The truth is simple: the economy runs on stability. Tariffs, new laws, even new ministries — business can adapt.

What kills growth is chaos. One thing in the morning, another by noon, something else by evening, and tomorrow — no one knows.

Wild swings — cuts one day, threats to allies the next, hugs with enemies after — leave businesses unable to plan or invest.

NATO’s response is limited. Weapons are sent to Poland, but no soldiers. Western European countries have armies too small to enter the fight.

Thousands of refugees from eastern Poland and bombed-out cities flee to Germany and France. Men send their families to safety.

After several months, Polish refugees encounter growing hostility from Germans and the French. Rumors spread about Poles allegedly cutting queues or refusing to pay at beauty salons because they are “refugees.”

As parliamentary elections approach, politicians from Germany’s AfD demand cuts to refugee benefits. Other politicians hesitate to speak out and say openly that Poles are fighting for freedom and deserve support.

More and more Germans and French insist that this is “not their war” and call for reducing aid to Poland.

At a concert by Paweł Kukiz in Berlin, about a dozen Polish refugees rush the stage. The incident triggers anti-Polish hysteria and demands to send Poles “back home.”

AfD organizes militias that patrol cities and hunt for Polish migrants.

Polish-speaking refugees hide in subway stations, while on the streets they are met with insults and shouts of “go back home.”

Putin is pleased: first he set Poland against Ukraine, and now Poland against Germany.

Remember this possible reality before shouting “Ukrainians, go home” or “This is not our war.”

Because you could become a migrant sooner than you think.”
